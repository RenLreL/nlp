Zahl der Abschiebungen steigt – auf niedrigem Niveau;Junge Freiheit;<a href='https://jungefreiheit.de/politik/deutschland/2025/zahl-der-abschiebungen-steigt-auf-niedrigem-niveau/' target='_blank'>Zahl der Abschiebungen steigt – auf niedrigem Niveau</a>;"BERLIN. In the first three months of this year, more people were deported from Germany than during the same period in previous years. A total of 6,151 foreign nationals were forced to leave the country. This information comes from the German federal government's response to a parliamentary inquiry by the Left Party, as reported by the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).

The time frame in question still falls under the responsibility of the red-green minority government. By the end of 2024, however, a significant number of individuals in Germany were under obligation to leave the country. If the number of deportations in the first quarter is projected over the entire year, more than 24,000 cases could occur in 2025. In 2024, approximately 20,000 migrants were deported, compared to around 16,500 in 2023.

In one out of every three deportations during the first quarter of 2025, authorities had to opt for the expensive method of chartering a plane. Group deportations to Pakistan were particularly costly, amounting to €462,000. Deportation flights to Ethiopia cost €418,000, and those to Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon totaled €380,000.

Most frequently, migrants were deported to Turkey, Georgia, France, Spain, and Serbia. Around 1,700 of the deportations were so-called “Dublin transfers,” where migrants were returned to the European country in which they first applied for asylum.

Fischer in Kolumbien: »Niemand wird allein­­­gelassen«;nd;<a href='https://www.nd-aktuell.de/artikel/1191553.santa-cruz-del-islote-fischer-in-kolumbien-niemand-wird-alleinsssgelassen.html' target='_blank'>Fischer in Kolumbien: »Niemand wird allein­­­gelassen«</a>;"Today, about 1,000 people live permanently on just half a hectare of land. But the dense population has been a reality here for a long time. The island used to be smaller, though almost as heavily inhabited. The island grows along with our community.

I was born in 1949, right here, in the middle of the sea. Back then, maybe 200 people lived here. There were no motorboats, no electricity, no [missing word]. But the island was always tiny and crowded, and the sea was always vast and endless – and our friend, our teacher, our calendar. When the waves grew higher, we knew: rain was coming. When the sea was calm, it was a good morning to fish.

The few houses were made of wood, the first ones built on stilts directly over the reef. At night, the wind would whistle through the boards, and sometimes it felt like the whole Islote was breathing.

According to our own stories and research, the first fishermen arrived about 330 years ago. They were men from the mainland. They spent the nights on the reef because there were no mosquitoes and it was safe to sleep there. During the day, they fished and searched for lobsters and shells. Eventually, they started building small shelters, stayed for several days at a time, and finally brought their families. A village grew from what began as a makeshift camp – on the reef, in the middle of the sea.

Space has always been limited, the ground naturally unstable, and everyone has to share every inch. Still, more people arrive, and most importantly, we have many children – and they all want their own homes someday. The island is bursting at the seams, yet there’s hardly a way to leave. And most people don’t want to leave anyway.

[Name missing], known as El Mono, is a fisherman, storyteller, historian, tour guide, tinkerer, diver, boatman, and head of the island guides’ council on the Colombian island of Santa Cruz del Islote.

Like my father and his father, I used to fish with a harpoon. Barefoot. No wetsuit, no air tank. Just a boat, alone. That’s also a way to escape the tightness of the island for a little while. Our fathers and grandfathers would dive down and come back with huge shells like it was nothing. And we children? We would watch – full of admiration. That’s how you learned respect. For elders, for nature, for the water.

The sea has always been our lifeline – and our wealth. Today, many people make a living from tourism too. The biggest attraction here is the aquarium, where you can see sharks up close. Most tourists don’t stay overnight – they come on organized trips and spend only half an hour here. They snorkel in the reef and take photos of the “smallest island in the world.”

Some of us work during the week on the mainland – in Cartagena or Tolú – and come home on weekends or for special holidays. That’s when the Islote feels especially crowded, loud, and alive – like a big family reunion.

But the most important thing is: we live off our community. No one is left behind. If someone has no money, people share what they have. If someone is sick, people help. If someone is building a house, neighbors come with tools to assist. That’s true. We have no pipelines, no public infrastructure. Everything that works here, we organized ourselves.

At some point, someone brought a generator from the mainland. Then we had light at night. During the day, the TV stays off – there’s no entertainment program – life happens outside.

Rainwater is collected in a large tank and distributed among the families – but it hasn’t rained in months. So now we have to buy water from a private desalination plant. It’s delivered by boat in large containers.

The school here at least has a small modem so the kids can learn how to use the internet. There’s a sports field on a neighboring island, but we don’t have a schoolyard. We do have three small shops, one right on the village square, where people gather, sip soft drinks, and catch up on local gossip.

Because we live so closely together, there are no secrets. No privacy. When someone laughs or cries – someone always hears. But that also has an upside: it creates connection.

We organize ourselves in collectives: there’s an island council, the highest authority – everyone is part of it, and leadership rotates. The tour guides have their own collective that decides who works when. Daily income is split evenly. The fishermen have an association too – if someone doesn’t catch anything, the others help out.

We’re extremely adaptable. We never have much, but we get by. Everyone knows everyone, and everyone helps everyone. And life here leaves lots of room for talking and improvising. There’s no crime, no locked doors.

Day-trippers are only allowed on the main path and in the aquarium. The rest of the island is ours.

Taking land from the sea is hard. We fill in tiny platforms with rubble, coral fragments, and sand carried in by tides – over time, they become plots of land. Sometimes it takes years. To the east, it’s the end – the reef suddenly drops off 30 meters. You can’t fill that in. There’s still a bit of room to the west – but that’s where the protected corals begin.

The real limit will probably come from our dependency on the mainland. Without it, nothing works: trash, drinking water, electricity. We have no police here, and the school is at risk of collapsing. The nearest hospital is far away – we have only an emergency team, two nurses, and one doctor.

Sometimes I feel like the state has forgotten us. We need support – also to develop alternatives to fishing and tourism. We could help with conservation efforts, with tracking biodiversity. We know the sea better than any drone or city diver.

Yes, absolutely – there’s more frustration now. Many young people want to go to the mainland, make TikTok videos, live a different life. I understand and support that. Because when they come back, they bring something with them: knowledge, questions, a new perspective. Now even the Islote has its own Instagram account.

We live with the sea – and with everything that moves within it. Some days, you lie on your back in the water, stare at the sky – and it feels like you’re floating between two worlds. But there are also days when you know: today’s not the day to go out.

People from the city look at the ocean and see a beautiful photo, a postcard. We see a story, a warning, a promise. The sea allows us to live – and it is our refuge. I want to protect that. I hope the younger generation doesn’t forget it. That they go out into the world – yes – but also come back. With new ideas. And the same heart.";left;{'center': 0.3345000147819519, 'left': 0.5622000098228455, 'left-center': 0.06629999727010727, 'right': 0.022299999371170998, 'right-center': 0.014600000344216824}
Die Kleinen hängt man;Junge Welt;<a href='https://www.jungewelt.de/artikel/500878.urteile-im-vw-dieselgate-die-kleinen-h%C3%A4ngt-man.html' target='_blank'>Die Kleinen hängt man</a>;"A full four years after the start of the Dieselgate trial against two former managers and two engineers of Volkswagen AG, the economic crimes chamber of the Braunschweig Regional Court delivered its verdicts on Monday. While the managers received suspended sentences, the engineers are heading to prison.

All four defendants were found guilty of particularly serious fraud during the trial, the court stated. It was proven that the defendants either helped plan or knowingly supported the use of illegal software designed to manipulate emissions values.

According to the verdict, former head of powertrain electronics Hanno Jelden must serve two years and seven months in prison. Jens Hadler, who was head of the diesel engine division at the time, received a sentence of four and a half years. In contrast, the sentences of one year and three months for former head of development Heinz-Jakob Neußer and one year and ten months for another former department head were suspended.

In their closing statements, the defendants expressed shock at the sentences sought by the prosecution—sentences that were largely upheld by the judges. Later that day, the defense teams announced they would appeal the verdicts.

During the trial, the defendants primarily pointed fingers at each other—and at then-CEO Martin Winterkorn. The question of who knew what, and when, could not be definitively resolved. As the head of the company at the time, Winterkorn is widely seen as bearing the main responsibility for the scandal uncovered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2015.

Winterkorn was originally set to be tried alongside the others, but his case was separated due to ""health reasons."" Since then, proceedings against the now 78-year-old have repeatedly been postponed, until a hearing was finally held in 2024. During that hearing, Winterkorn denied all allegations and emphasized that the scandal had damaged his successful career.

A few months later, the case was once again suspended after Winterkorn suffered an accident at home. The trial was scheduled to resume in early 2025, but that did not happen either. Whether a verdict will ever be reached against what was once Germany’s highest-paid CEO remains unclear. A U.S. lawsuit against Winterkorn failed due to Germany’s refusal to extradite him.

After the criminal activities came to light in September 2015, Winterkorn acknowledged mistakes and promised a full investigation. ""Manipulation and Volkswagen—this must never happen again,"" he said at the time. One day later, he resigned and has contributed little to the investigation since. Instead, the company’s top management appeared in the following years to be more focused on protecting themselves, allowing lower-ranking employees to take the fall.

The scandal has its roots in the early 2000s: as early as 2006, VW was developing the fraudulent software, which was installed in about 11 million diesel vehicles between 2008 and 2015. The software could detect when a car was being tested and would activate a cleaner emissions mode during the test. This mode would significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions under test conditions—while in real-world driving, the emissions were up to 40 times higher than legal limits and came with lower performance and higher fuel consumption.

According to Volkswagen, the legal fallout from the scandal has cost the already embattled company around €33 billion so far. However, the matter is far from over with Monday’s verdict. According to a court spokesperson, four additional proceedings involving 31 more defendants are ongoing in Braunschweig. Charges against 47 other accused individuals were dropped in exchange for financial settlements.";center;{'center': 0.819599986076355, 'left': 0.08100000023841858, 'left-center': 0.0706000030040741, 'right': 0.01549999974668026, 'right-center': 0.013299999758601189}
"Regierung dringt auf ""Tempo, Tempo, Tempo""";tagesschau;"<a href='https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/innenpolitik/koalitionsausschuss-korri-100.html' target='_blank'>Regierung dringt auf ""Tempo, Tempo, Tempo""</a>";"Lars Klingbeil’s watch actually showed exactly 7:00 PM when the party leaders sat down at the table for a press conference in the Chancellor's Office. Alongside Klingbeil, Friedrich Merz, Markus Söder, and Saskia Esken all unanimously emphasized how constructive—and even harmonious—this first meeting had been. It almost sounded as if they were intentionally highlighting that the dynamic in the government has changed since the coalition was formed, where the coalition committee was more of a crisis management tool than a regular exchange, as Merz now intends to run it. No leaks, no party spin. Merz specifically pointed this out in his statement: “This is how I envision it.”

And after the first phase of the chancellorship focused on foreign policy, this could certainly be seen as a starting point for domestic policy, which Merz had not yet focused on in the first three weeks of his government. However, expectations are high that Merz will deliver something here. In his first government statement on May 14, he promised: “I want you, the citizens of our country, to feel that things are slowly changing for the better by the summer.” Summer is now just around the corner, or as Söder put it today, “We need speed, speed, speed.”

Professional, sober—this was the approach they wanted to take today, working from the so-called ""project lists"" of the individual ministries, which one participant referred to as a ""wish list."" Not everything on it is a priority, so the big task for the party leaders tonight was to highlight only the measures that should be implemented quickly: everything that could help lift the German economy out of recession. The individual initiatives are listed in bullet points: from the announcement of bringing the billions in special funds literally to the streets, to the promise of financially easing the burden on companies. The coalition calls it an ""investment booster.""

However, the most frequently used word in the ""immediate program"" is another: acceleration. Everything is supposed to happen faster. Even the major pension reform is set to get underway. The coalition plans to push the first laws through the Bundesrat by July. Will it work? It sounds ambitious. When it comes to legislative projects, the most challenging work is usually in the details, not just in the bullet-point listing of individual initiatives.

Kapitalistischer »Fortschritt« führt in die Katastrophe;Jacobin;<a href='https://www.jacobin.de/artikel/fortschritt-walter-benjamin-linke-klima' target='_blank'>Kapitalistischer »Fortschritt« führt in die Katastrophe</a>;"Samuel Farber’s article titled ""..."" is very reasonable and factual. We agree on many points, but there are some important aspects where I see things differently. I would like to briefly explain these differences. Is Walter Benjamin—like other Western Marxists—really a thinker who wanted to ""stay away from politics and economics,"" as Farber suggests? Benjamin can certainly be criticized in many ways, but I find it hard to deny the political character of his writings. It’s true that he didn’t belong to a political party, but that doesn’t mean he stayed away from politics. Karl Marx also didn’t belong to a party during the years he wrote. Does that mean he wasn’t a political thinker at that time?

According to Farber, Benjamin imagined revolution as ""a sudden, cataclysmic, messianic event in which the emergency brake would be pulled on the 'locomotives of world history'—which aimed more to prevent further catastrophes than to open up a better future."" However, Benjamin’s idea is shaped by a dialectical vision that combines both aspects: preventing catastrophes—a product of historical progress under the ruling classes—and opening up new future perspectives. In a postscript to one of his theses from The Origin of German Tragic Drama, Benjamin refers to the realization of a classless society (the ""new future"" in Marxism) as the goal of revolution. However, he does not see this as the result of progress. For him, the classless society should not be understood as the endpoint of historical development but as its interruption.

Farber quotes from our book: ""Philosopher Michael Löwy and literary scholar Robert Sayre (in German, approximately ‘Romanticism against the Pull of Modernity’) identified various currents of this left-wing romanticism. The 'New Rousseauism,' for example, viewed the beginnings of human history as an idealized golden age."" However, for us—and this also applies to Jean-Jacques Rousseau—it is crucial that there is no call for a return to the past (to a supposedly ""golden age""), but rather a detour through the past towards a utopian future. Rousseau admired the indigenous Caribbean peoples, but he did not suggest they should continue to live as they did. Instead, he dreamed of a new, democratic society in which the former freedom and equality of humanity would be revived in a new form. The same holds true for Ernst Bloch: Farber mentions his fascination with the Middle Ages, but Bloch was more than that—he was a great utopian philosopher. He referred to the past to criticize capitalist ""progress,"" not to advocate a return to the Middle Ages! His goal was a future communist society in the Marxist sense.

Farber’s interpretation of E.P. Thompson, however, seems much more accurate to me: It is not about restoring a lost community, but about creating a new one that breaks with the ruthless, anti-social logic of capitalism. According to Farber, Ferdinand Tönnies is the most influential author we engage with in our book. However, as we write—and as Farber himself notes—Tönnies is a ""resigned romantic thinker"" and, as such, does not belong to the revolutionary-romantic tradition.

I fully agree with another of Farber’s arguments: We must oppose the ""political economy of capitalism"" with an alternative political economy—one that involves democratic planning and sets priorities for production. However, I do not believe in the possibility of economic growth that is not ecologically harmful. In my view, Farber underestimates the severity of the ecological crisis: Capitalist ""progress,"" with its logic of unlimited growth, is leading us into an unprecedented catastrophe in human history: climate change. This threatens the survival of humanity. If we want to avoid such a fate, we must reduce our energy consumption and material production, starting with useless and unnecessary goods, which make up the bulk of capitalist production.

Certainly, in an alternative civilizational model, which we call eco-socialism, it will be necessary to satisfy the basic social needs of humanity. But, as Marx outlined, the first step toward freedom is shortening the workday and creating free time, which enables people to engage in self-realization.";left;{'center': 0.2797999978065491, 'left': 0.6471999883651733, 'left-center': 0.035599999129772186, 'right': 0.021800000220537186, 'right-center': 0.015599999576807022}

In the center of Remscheid, an eleven-year-old Iraqi child seriously injured a 13-year-old German with a knife. After an argument at school, three pupils are said to have arranged a fight in Theatergasse in the afternoon. However, the migrant did not use his fists, but drew a knife after the first blow from the two-year-old child. He used it to stab his opponent twice in the leg with full force, as the newspaper first reported. The eleven-year-old and the other classmate then fled the scene, leaving the seriously injured boy behind. However, the stab wounds are not said to be life-threatening. An emergency doctor who was called was able to treat the 13-year-old in the city center. The boy was then taken to hospital. Meanwhile, the police searched for the Iraqi and were able to arrest him near his parents' home. He is still under the age of criminal responsibility. He is therefore not at risk of criminal proceedings. Adolescents in Germany can only be tried if they are 14 years old or older. The police handed the offender over to staff from the youth welfare office at the police station. They considered placing him in an appropriate institution. In the end, they decided against it.The parents were able to pick up their son at police headquarters and take him home, even though they had already been looked after by Remscheid youth welfare services in the past. A few hours earlier, there had also been a knife attack at a school in Berlin-Spandau. In the process . He survived after emergency surgery. The perpetrator and victim are both said to be German nationals.

»Lehrer verschieben gern die Verantwortung auf die Schüler«;nd;<a href='https://www.nd-aktuell.de/artikel/1191554.inklusives-lernen-lehrer-verschieben-gern-die-verantwortung-auf-die-schueler.html' target='_blank'>»Lehrer verschieben gern die Verantwortung auf die Schüler«</a>;"It could be from now, but also from the 80s. It shows exactly the problem: Here, something has been attributed to a person without knowing why they don't do something and whether it really has anything to do with their personality. Appreciative, acknowledging feedback wouldn't be formulated this way. It targets situations, processes, and not the person as a personality. Sometimes, verbal judgments can hurt more than a grade. Standardization isn't the problem at all. Even verbal feedback needs certain criteria to be met, otherwise it becomes arbitrary. A verbal judgment should help students improve their work habits or their learning processes. But this here is just a list of traits, without connection to the learning process. And that a child doesn't want to do certain things is an educational problem, not a problem of the child. Teachers like to shift the responsibility for the learning process onto the students.

She teaches as a professor of educational science at the Technical University of Dresden. She co-developed a concept for a community school where new forms of – including inclusive – teaching and learning were to be developed and researched. This concept is being implemented as a joint school experiment by the university and the city under Langner's scientific leadership: It opened in 2019 as a public and free primary and secondary school under one roof. Now, it is a community school that goes up to the Abitur. Currently, about 850 children are learning here. In the 2023/24 school year, the first students took the Hauptschule exam. In the current 2024/25 school year, the first cohort will take both the Hauptschule and Realschule exams.

It is a very deficit-oriented view. The student has to adapt; it's not about understanding why it's not meaningful for them to do certain things. This is the classic idea you still find today: The teacher has an expectation of the students, and they must meet this expectation. I would always say: The teacher has an expectation to meet. He has the task of removing all barriers that prevent the learning process of a child from progressing. To do this, he must first understand the barriers, but this is not the child's responsibility, it is the teacher's.

The feedback would rather be: I have observed that you don't like doing certain tasks. And then you can discuss this with the student. But that is dialogical and would not be written on a report card.

Starting from the fourth grade, we have goal-setting and review conversations at the University School Dresden – even though it sounds terrible – in which the student jointly determines what they plan to accomplish in the next six weeks. And after six weeks, you discuss: What have you achieved? What went well? What did you find challenging? What would you need to do differently? Where do you need more support? This process is accompanied daily by a logbook in which daily goals are formulated and reflected upon at the end of the day.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we in educational science have been strongly discussing self-regulated or self-organized learning. After kindergarten, children could be easily introduced to this, as by then, they have learned a lot without anyone standing in front telling them what to learn. There is an intrinsic motivation to learn. A human wants to acquire the world and engage with it. Nevertheless, they need to grow into the responsibility for their own learning process through educational guidance.

A student raised in a traditionally teacher-centered classroom cannot naturally do this. If I want to lead students to a more self-regulated learning, I must practice this with them. Of course, there are very different students. Some only need to speak in the goal-setting conversations every quarter because they process things continuously. And then there are students who need a weekly nudge to be told: What was the plan? Where do you stand now? Why haven't you done this by then? Not reproachfully, but accountably. The students should learn to reflect on this and then deduce what they need to do differently.

A school in a socially disadvantaged area means that the student body is no longer heterogeneous, but gentrified. This is a huge problem. The University School is a community school and intentionally has a cross-section of society, so we have both students from an educational background who don't initially have much interest in learning, and there are also the classic academic children. Additionally, much of the learning works well peer-to-peer and across grades. At our school, first graders are taken by the hand by third graders, the same happens with the fourth and fifth grades. Students can convey the culture of learning to each other much better than if the teacher constantly demands it. And because it's a mixed group, the teacher has more time for the students who need it, because there are others who don't need as much support.

From ninth grade, when the first school-leaving exams approach. But not before. The counter-question would be: Why do you need a grade? But why are our Abitur results always improving, and our PISA results always getting worse? Because grading is always just the benchmark for a class and a purely subjective feeling of the teacher. An average math student is in the lower third of a class with many very good students. In a class without math prodigies, they are in the upper third. The grade is not an objective measure. To socially position oneself, you can use it, but then you're only positioning yourself among your 27 classmates, not in comparison to real potentials or your actual abilities.

The second point is: The grade is a blanket judgment. If I can't do probability calculations but can quickly calculate in my head, I might get a three in math. But what does this number mean? With us, it says that I only have a basic understanding of probability calculations, but that I can do mental arithmetic 100%. If an employer wants to know if a candidate is suitable, they can make much more sense of that.

This differentiated perspective is also helpful for the educational process. What do I know as a new math teacher if someone has a four? I can only understand where I need to start if I know more precisely where the problem lies. Even in geometry! We have just as many teachers and educators as a regular school. But we work with a digital learning and school management software developed by a Czech startup. At the end, you just press a button and say: Please create a report card from this! Honestly, I have to say: It's still not perfect, we're still working on it.

There is also pressure to perform at our school. Because we also write success proofs. But I sign up for that when I feel ready. Yes, that's how we do it. Learning cannot be controlled from the outside, you can only create the right learning environment. After school, in working life, you have to produce something within a certain time, but never again do you have to learn something within a certain time, like in traditional schools: learning something at speed in several subjects and reproducing it. That creates stress, which is extremely negatively charged. In essence, we are preparing people not to want to learn or continue their education. In the end, it is an educational policy decision, and those decisions are not made by educational scientists. School cannot be changed within one legislative period. That's why it never gets touched. Educational science has no relevance to education policy.

I interpret it differently. Saxony has been a winner for years, but only in relation, because everyone is getting worse, even Saxony. Also, Saxony always has an advantage because it selects so strongly. In the PISA tests, special needs schools are not represented, meaning the stronger the selective system, the cleaner the data on students. Other federal states like Berlin or Bremen have a high inclusion rate. Students with special educational needs sit in regular schools there and are part of the sample.

The other thing is that in these competency tests, it's also disputed whether they measure what we really need. I have the experience in Saxony that students are very good at reproducing knowledge, but not good at applying knowledge, in creativity, and in self-efficacy. This is not assessed by PISA, but it would be highly recommended. This is important for society in light of the many crisis situations, but also for whether people feel comfortable in their own skin and believe they can handle challenges or change something. We conduct self-efficacy studies at the University School. There are also studies that show a correlation between performance and self-efficacy from a certain age onward. From my perspective, school should help to unlock individual potential. This is still not achieved very well with our school system.";left;{'center': 0.1753000020980835, 'left': 0.763700008392334, 'left-center': 0.02500000037252903, 'right': 0.020999999716877937, 'right-center': 0.014999999664723873}
Viele Männer, große Ziele;tagesschau;<a href='https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/innenpolitik/koalitionsausschuss-maenner-frauen-100.html' target='_blank'>Viele Männer, große Ziele</a>;"At the beginning of his term, Friedrich Merz set an exceptionally ambitious goal. He wants the citizens to feel that something has changed in Germany by the summer and that things are moving forward. Typical Merz, the anti-Scholz. Not vague, but steep. This is how the mood shift is supposed to be governed. The coalition committee will now set the course for this, determining what should be put on the table and, at best, implemented by summer. It's about priorities. And who sets them? In addition to Merz, these are the people who make decisions for the CDU, CSU, and SPD, i.e., important people. Eight men and one woman. Jens Spahn, as the Union faction leader, is part of it, as is Carsten Linnemann, the CDU general secretary. Markus Söder also comes with two men from the CSU. While women from the Union can be found in the cabinet, they do not hold the more important positions of power and, therefore, are not part of the coalition committee. Lars Klingbeil, the SPD leader, brings his co-chair, Saskia Esken, alongside faction leader Matthias Miersch. Eight to one. This causes outrage, not only among women but also among the Jusos, such as Benedict Lang. ""Our expectation remains the same,"" he says, ""half of the power to women, that's our demand, and it must be realized."" The coalition committee is far from meeting that expectation. Men dominate the body that is supposed to play such an important role in this coalition. It is meant to meet once a month and set the direction. It's about more economic growth, less migration, the citizens' income, which is supposed to be abolished, and, not least this time: signals. Merz wants to show that his coalition doesn't ""traffic light,"" that it can do it better than the previous government and the AfD. It's also about Merz, the chancellor, who still has to earn the trust of the citizens. So far, he has mainly appeared as the exterior chancellor. Now, it’s about showing that he also wants to make a difference in Germany. Because the mood shift in the country will probably be achieved more with policies for Lusatia, Gelsenkirchen, or Kaiserslautern than with glossy pictures in Paris or Warsaw. Unity is also something Merz formulated as a goal in his government statement. He wants to foster unity, especially where it has been lost. However, the chancellor must also foster unity within the coalition. The start was sometimes a bit bumpy because some said thoughtless things publicly or others wanted to leave their own mark. But Merz can’t afford that – his coalition is supposed to become the anti-traffic light coalition, especially without public disputes. And now, into this mix steps CSU leader Markus Söder, known for having his own head. He wants to put his priorities for Bavaria on the list in the coalition committee. Commuter allowance, restaurant tax, mother’s pension: it’s all a matter of money. At least, there seems to be consensus that something should be done first for economic growth. That’s what Friedrich Merz wants, that’s what Lars Klingbeil says, and that’s what Markus Söder will want too. Would women see it differently? Probably not. Still, Nina Warken, the new chair of the Women’s Union, wants to talk to Merz and see if there’s any way a woman from the CDU can have a say in the coalition committee. And with that, she also has a very ambitious goal.";left;{'center': 0.3449000120162964, 'left': 0.5737000107765198, 'left-center': 0.042500000447034836, 'right': 0.022299999371170998, 'right-center': 0.016599999740719795}

On Tuesday, the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office authorized raids on the houses, apartments, and office spaces of members of the association ""Friedensbrücke – Kriegsopferhilfe e.V."" in Berlin, as well as in the Brandenburg municipalities of Wandlitz and Königs Wusterhausen, under the accusation of supporting such organizations. An investigation under criminal law paragraph 129 b is only possible if the Federal Ministry of Justice has previously granted its authorization. The association has provided humanitarian aid since the beginning of the Ukrainian civil war following the Maidan coup, allegedly helping the Russian-speaking residents of Donbas, who were under pressure from the Kyiv army and partly openly neo-Nazi militias. The association’s chairperson, Liane Kilinc, speaks of over 800 projects implemented over ten years under the ""help for self-help"" concept. For example, sewing machines were delivered to set up a sewing workshop, and construction materials were provided to repair schools and kindergartens. However, the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office accuses the association of supporting the self-defense forces of the people's republics until 2022. Among those searched by the Federal Criminal Police Office were the association’s office in Berlin-Friedrichshain and the apartment of the treasurer, as first reported by the media. Arrest warrants have been issued against Kilinc and one other person, but they could not be executed, as the two individuals are said to be in Russia. At least Kilinc has not concealed this fact. Since August 2022, the 53-year-old has lived in Moscow, where she was granted political asylum in 2023 and also acquired Russian citizenship in April of this year. She continues to be involved in helping Donbas, as she explained in an interview in January. The association has already experienced repression in the past. For example, its bank accounts were canceled, and its charitable status was revoked due to ""political activities outside the association's statutes,"" as reported in early 2023. Journalists from the Springer newspaper had previously presented a photo to the Brandenburg tax office, showing the association's board members with the flag of the Donetsk People's Republic in front of a civilian truck with a Z symbol. The state’s actions have been prepared for in the media. For example, on May 5, an article titled ""Kremlin Propaganda at Odesaplatz: Moscow-Affiliated Association Demonstrates in Berlin-Karlshorst"" stirred up sentiment. The background of the lengthy article was a memorial rally marking the anniversary of the pogrom by Ukrainian fascists at the trade union house in Odessa on May 2, 2014. At the event, attended by nearly two dozen participants, an activist from ""Friedensbrücke"" also spoke. The article claims that the association organizes ""alleged aid convoys"" but questions whether only civilian goods are being transported. To support this, it repeats the claim made in 2023 by the investigative portal based in Estonia, stating that ""Friedensbrücke"" had delivered so-called dual-use goods, including two tons of lubricating oil, to militias. According to the association, it had to stop its aid transports from Germany in 2022 due to Western sanction threats.";center;{'center': 0.7512000203132629, 'left': 0.1671999990940094, 'left-center': 0.04820000007748604, 'right': 0.01899999938905239, 'right-center': 0.014499999582767487}
Verteidigung des Fortschritts;Jacobin;<a href='https://www.jacobin.de/artikel/fortschritt-linke-zukunft-pessimismus' target='_blank'>Verteidigung des Fortschritts</a>;"""I grew up in the early 1950s in Marianao, a neighborhood near the Cuban capital, Havana. I still remember how excited the people in our neighborhood were when the side streets of the community were paved and the road connecting Marianao to Havana was widened. Even my Jewish immigrant parents, who had only recently learned that their entire family had been wiped out in the Holocaust, shared this hopeful sense of progress. Neither they nor our neighbors—or Cubans in general—took this progress for granted or as something inevitable. These and similar experiences explain how material progress became part of what the sociologist Alvin Gouldner would have called my 'background assumptions'—the fundamental views and ideas about politics and the world that immediately shape an individual. My beliefs were strengthened when I attended the University of Chicago in the early 1960s. From the city's elevated trains, I could see the dilapidated and impoverished ghettos of the South Side, which reminded me of the poverty I knew from home. Although I was aware that the political left in the U.S. did not share my views on material progress in its entirety, I was nonetheless impressed by the growing number of left-wing academics and intellectuals who began to question what progress meant and whether it was even desirable. Prominent among these currents was the Frankfurt School, a part of the intellectual-political phenomenon that historian Perry Anderson has referred to as 'Western Marxism.' This was a highly diverse group of intellectuals, including figures like Walter Benjamin, Lucio Colletti, Lucien Goldmann, and Karl Korsch. Despite their different perspectives, all of these thinkers had one thing in common: their reaction to the defeat of classical Marxism by fascism, Stalinism, and social democracy, and their tendency to distance themselves from politics and economics, focusing instead on philosophical questions—usually with an idealistic tendency disconnected from actual practice. This revolt against classical Marxism helps explain a divide that emerged within the left: the divide between left-wing activists and organizers, who adhere to a practical belief in progress that justifies their involvement in social struggles, and many left-wing intellectuals, who primarily criticize the concept of progress.""";center;{'center': 0.39480000734329224, 'left': 0.22200000286102295, 'left-center': 0.3456999957561493, 'right': 0.019700000062584877, 'right-center': 0.017799999564886093}

Former Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has strongly opposed the rejection of illegal migrants at Germany’s borders, a measure that the new government intends to enforce. At an event in Neu-Ulm on Wednesday, she criticized the policies: ""I do not believe that we can finally combat illegal migration at the German-Austrian or German-Polish borders."" She was actually supposed to read from her autobiography ""Freiheit"" but also commented on current politics. In a conversation with the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Ulrich Becker, she was clear and called for the continuation of her own migration policy, which has brought millions of foreigners, mainly from the Islamic world, to Germany. Green Bundestag member Marcel Emmerich was present at the event, filmed Merkel’s warnings, and spread them on social media. ""If border controls become a permanent state, it will cost us freedom of movement in the EU."" – Angela Merkel yesterday. The government is flying blind with border controls and is anti-European. The black-red coalition is severely attacking European unity. — Marcel Emmerich (@herr_emmerich)

""I have always advocated for European solutions,"" she said, calling on her successor, Friedrich Merz (CDU), in front of 900 listeners, to focus on protecting the EU's external borders. Merkel warned him and Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) that their policies could destroy the EU. Unilateral actions by individual countries could cost the freedom of movement in Europe. Already, she said from personal experience, ""it has become much, much more uncomfortable"" just to drive to Szczecin. The border controls are ""very, very annoying."" Many people no longer do this. Solutions can only be found within the EU, not in Germany: ""Otherwise, we might experience that Europe is being destroyed, and I don’t want that."" During the election campaign, the 70-year-old had already expressed this. This non-committal proposal had found a majority with the votes of the AfD. However, the Immigration Limitation Act failed because twelve Merkel supporters from the CDU/CSU refused to approve it.

Weniger Arbeit, mehr Wohlstand?;nd;<a href='https://www.nd-aktuell.de/artikel/1191560.arbeitszeitdebatte-weniger-arbeit-mehr-wohlstand.html' target='_blank'>Weniger Arbeit, mehr Wohlstand?</a>;"Politicians and economists are once again calling for longer working hours. However, this contradicts the needs of many people. In light of the renewed debate, we have compiled how actual and desired working hours have developed. We also ask about the value of free time. Chancellor Friedrich Merz demands that people work more to maintain the ""prosperity of this country."" In contrast, full-time employees, in particular, have been wanting shorter working hours for many years. This is shown by surveys from the Socio-Economic Panel (Soep), which were analyzed by the Institute for Employment Research for a study in 2023. In 2021, women with full-time jobs wanted to work an average of about six hours less per week, and men wanted to work 5.5 hours less. And this was even if their salary would decrease accordingly. More time outside of work is so valuable for many that they would accept somewhat less material wealth in exchange. ""Time prosperity is a form of prosperity in its own right,"" says Jürgen Rinderspacher, a time researcher at the University of Münster, in nd.DieWoche. Time prosperity includes, first of all, sufficient time outside of employment as well as enough self-determined time. It is also important that people can spend time together, for example on weekends, and that employment is not so compressed that work hours can essentially be written off as life hours. Many employees now want more time outside of their jobs. In light of the increasing intensification of work, a general reduction in working hours, aiming for a shorter and healthier full-time workweek of 30 hours, is considered appropriate, wrote economists from the Vienna Chamber of Labour two years ago. This is emphasized by economist Daniel Haim from the AK Wien. On the other hand, part-time workers wish, on average, to work longer hours. However, when considering all employees together, people, on average, want shorter working hours. In the Soep survey, the specific question was: ""If you could choose your working hours and consider that your income would change accordingly: How many hours per week would you prefer to work?"" Looking at all employees together, the average working hours per person have decreased by more than 10% since the 1990s. This is primarily because more people are working part-time today. For some time now, full-time employees' working hours have also been decreasing. One key reason: people are doing fewer overtime hours, and working time accounts are being reduced. Sometimes employees can decide for themselves. However, often the order situation of companies is the determining factor for whether people do overtime or reduce their working time accounts. The total volume of work in Germany has grown significantly over the past 20 years. Last year, all employees worked more hours than ever since reunification. And this, despite the fact that working hours per person have decreased. This has been possible, especially because more women and older workers are now employed. Additionally, more migrants are working in Germany than before, in care facilities, factories, and offices. Instead of calling for even more work now, we should ask: Which work is important, and what can be left out? Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a highly important metric in political debates. Since reunification, GDP has risen sharply, though it has recently declined slightly. A central political goal is now to make the economy grow again, climate change notwithstanding. This is also why more work is being demanded: it is supposed to serve economic growth. Implicitly, an increasing GDP is equated with more prosperity. However, GDP does not say anything about the distribution of wealth. And time prosperity in the form of self-determined time outside of work is completely irrelevant here.

Tagebuch aus der Ukraine;taz;<a href='https://taz.de/Tagebuch-aus-der-Ukraine/!6090811/' target='_blank'>Tagebuch aus der Ukraine</a>;"Despite the destruction and danger, the residents of Kharkiv are returning. Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia, nearly one and a half million people lived here. In the first months following the attacks, only about 400,000 remained. Despite daily attacks, around 1.3 million people now live in the city again. At the train station, my friend Ada picks me up. ""Do you want to see what Kharkiv is like now?"" she asks. Three years ago, when she was just 23, she dropped out of her studies at Oxford, moved to Ukraine, and founded the charity KHARPP, which helps rebuild houses destroyed by Russian attacks. We get into her huge SUV. My eyes linger on the details: a short skirt, velvet boots with massive heels, long and striking nails—she looks like someone who should be modeling for a glossy magazine, not someone driving a dirty off-road vehicle. I imagine her in this outfit racing across the broken streets near the front line, confidently passing the roadblocks. Ada notices my gaze. ""I once worked with a woman who volunteered. She always had a flawless manicure. I complimented her on it, and she responded: 'My nails are always in good condition – it reminds me that life is not just about war,'"" says Ada, smiling. Over time, I can see it not just when I look at Ada: this beautiful, stubborn will to live. Like a spark in the darkness, it burns in the hearts of many of Kharkiv's residents. It especially glows when there is almost no light left. Even the city itself seems to have learned how to absorb the darkness and turn it into something alive. We pass by a restaurant where lunch tables stand amidst the rubble. The walls, showing traces of shrapnel, are softly lit. Waiters quietly move between the tables. The guests drink cocktails and chat. Like in any other city, like on any other evening. Kharkiv has around 1,600 restaurants and cafes, and new ones are constantly opening – last year alone, 60 new ones. In the evening, we go to one of them. It’s lightly raining, the air is filled with alarm sounds, the streets are empty and shrouded in twilight. But as soon as we open the door, we are greeted by warmth. And by Ukrainian fusion appetizers. Not a second in this city stands still. There are concerts, theater premieres, exhibitions. No wonder the club closest to the front is currently in Kharkiv. It is the center of new culture. In 2023, the Kharkiv band ""Some People"" opened this gathering place for students, soldiers, and artists. It is a place where they can all feel alive again. In this city, it’s definitely not about survival. Kharkiv stands for choice and freedom. It is the city of those who are building something new in the middle of war.

Das Kabinett hat zwei Gesetzentwürfe von Bundesinnenminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) verabschiedet, die nun die Zustimmung des Bundestags benötigen. Die Änderungen betreffen vor allem den Familiennachzug und die beschleunigte Einbürgerung für gut integrierte Einwanderer.

Ein zentraler Punkt ist, dass Menschen mit subsidiärem Schutzstatus – also Geflüchtete, die keinen Asyl- oder Flüchtlingsschutz erhalten, aber aus Schutzgründen in Deutschland bleiben dürfen – künftig keine Familienangehörigen mehr nachholen können. Bisher war es möglich, jährlich bis zu 12.000 Angehörige von subsidiär Schutzberechtigten einreisen zu lassen. In Zukunft sollen diese Personen für mindestens zwei Jahre vom Familiennachzug ausgeschlossen werden. Ausnahmen für ""Härtefälle"" sind vorgesehen, jedoch ohne genaue Definition im Gesetzentwurf.

Zudem möchte die Regierung die von der vorherigen Ampelkoalition eingeführte beschleunigte Einbürgerung für besonders gut integrierte Einwanderer, die nach nur drei Jahren eine Staatsbürgerschaft erhalten konnten, wieder zurücknehmen. Die sogenannten „Turbo-Einbürgerungen“ waren bereits in der Opposition ein Streitpunkt für die Union. Trotzdem bleiben andere Reformen des Staatsbürgerschaftsrechts bestehen, wie die Reduzierung der Wartefrist für eine normale Einbürgerung von acht auf fünf Jahre und die Erlaubnis zum Doppelpass.

Neben der Migrationspolitik hat das Kabinett auch Maßnahmen zur Beschleunigung des Netzausbaus beschlossen. Geplant ist eine Änderung des Telekommunikationsgesetzes, um den Ausbau von Glasfaser- und Mobilfunknetzen voranzutreiben. Diese Infrastruktur soll als ""überragendes öffentliches Interesse"" deklariert werden, um Genehmigungsprozesse zu beschleunigen. Digitalminister Karsten Wildberger (CDU) betont, dass leistungsfähige Telekommunikationsnetze ein entscheidender Standortfaktor in der digitalen Welt sind.

Ein weiteres Thema, das die neue Regierung vorantreibt, betrifft den Bau auf stillgelegten Bahngrundstücken. Diese Flächen sollen nun für den Bau von kommunalen Wohnungen oder andere Projekte freigegeben werden, wenn dies im „überragenden öffentlichen Interesse“ liegt.

Darüber hinaus wurde Hendrik Streeck, der bekannte Virologe aus der Corona-Pandemie, als neuer Drogenbeauftragter der Bundesregierung benannt. Die neue Koalition setzt damit auch ihre Ziele aus dem Koalitionsvertrag um, die den Ausbau digitaler Infrastruktur und die Verbesserung von Bauvorhaben betreffen.

Diese ersten Schritte der Koalition spiegeln den Versuch wider, ihre Versprechen hinsichtlich einer strikteren Migrationspolitik und einer rascheren Umsetzung von Infrastrukturprojekten umzusetzen.

According to the reports, ten hostages held in the Gaza Strip should be released in two stages within a week. Additionally, the bodies of 18 abducted individuals should be handed over. In exchange, Palestinian prisoners should be released again. According to the reports, discussions about ending the Gaza War should take place during the two-month ceasefire. In the event of an agreement between Israel and the Islamist Hamas, the remaining hostages and the remains of the abducted individuals should be handed over. The proposal also calls for the resumption of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip by the United Nations and international relief organizations. The Israeli army should withdraw to positions it held before the start of the recent offensive in March, the reports further state. According to Israeli sources, at least 20 living hostages are still in the Gaza Strip. The fate of three other abducted individuals is unclear, as it is uncertain whether they are still alive. Additionally, the bodies of 35 abducted individuals are located in the isolated area, which is filled with countless underground tunnel systems. (dpa)

The far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has announced the establishment of 22 new settlements in the occupied West Bank. ""We have made a historic decision for the development of settlements: 22 new communities in Judea and Samaria,"" he declared on Thursday on the online platform X, using the Israeli term for the West Bank. The settlements are considered illegal under international law. This move could further escalate Israel's already strained relations with parts of the international community. According to a map released by the Likud Party of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the 22 planned settlements are spread across the entire West Bank. The party stated on the online platform Telegram that the initiative is led by Smotrich and Defense Minister Israel Katz and has been approved by the security cabinet. Israel took control of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip during the Six-Day War of 1967. Under international law, the establishment of Israeli settlements in these Palestinian territories is illegal. Despite protests from abroad, Israel has built dozens of settlements in the West Bank over the past decades, where more than 490,000 Israelis now live alongside approximately three million Palestinians.

In the Gaza Strip, thousands of Palestinians stormed a warehouse of the UN World Food Program (WFP). AFP reporters on Wednesday evening reported from Deir al-Balah that people had broken into the warehouse and taken bags and boxes of food supplies. Gunshots were also heard. ""Initial reports indicate that two people have died and several others have been injured in this tragic incident,"" WFP wrote on the online platform X. ""Humanitarian needs have spiraled out of control after 80 days of a complete blockade of all food aid and other humanitarian supplies to Gaza,"" WFP stated. It urgently called for ""safe and unhindered humanitarian access to immediately enable orderly food distribution throughout the Gaza Strip."" The day before, at least 47 people were injured in a chaotic food distribution by the newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), supported by the U.S. The Israeli military emphasized that soldiers did not shoot at civilians. (afp)

Thousands of people have demonstrated in Tel Aviv for an end to the Gaza War and the immediate release of the hostages who are still in the hands of the Islamist Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Relatives reminded people on Wednesday that their loved ones – 58 hostages, some of whom are no longer alive – have now been held captive for 600 days. On the Hostage Square in the center of the Israeli coastal metropolis Tel Aviv, numerous people gathered in the evening to remember the fate of the hostages. The mother of hostage Alon Ohel spoke on stage, addressing her son in Gaza: ""Tonight, we count 600 days without you. And you count the seconds – almost 52 million seconds."" Released hostages also shared their experiences. ""In the tunnels, you never know if a terrorist will wake up one morning and just shoot you, or if the tunnel you're sleeping in will be blown up by a bomb,"" said Iair Horn, who was freed in February and whose brother Eitan is still held by extremists in the Gaza Strip. Before the rally, chaotic scenes unfolded on the square between demonstrators and the police. According to a report by the news site Ynet, about 20 people were arrested in front of the headquarters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party. They had previously occupied the party building and blocked the streets outside. (dpa)

Since Wednesday, residents of the city of Langen and the municipality of Egelsbach in the Offenbach district can now be chauffeured ""driverlessly"" around the area in ""autonomous"" shuttles. The joint pilot project called KIRA (AI-based regular operation of autonomous on-demand services) by DB and the Rhein-Main Transport Association (RMV) is initially set to run until the end of the year, but could be extended in the event of success, possibly with further federal funding. But what would success mean? If none of the test participants are harmed and the ""safety drivers"" who are present for security reasons nod off out of sheer boredom? Or would it please the bosses if even more frustrated train passengers soon switched to cars? In line with this, the core business, the railways, is currently being actively dismantled – both in terms of staff and infrastructure. Because the economy is sluggish at the moment, and fewer people and goods are rolling along the tracks, the state-owned company is pushing for the closure of locations of DB Vehicle Maintenance (FZI). In the twelve factories in question, trains and carriages are completely refurbished. ""It’s about what’s called heavy maintenance,"" explained a spokesperson for the Railway and Transport Union (EVG) on Tuesday. As he said, the declining ""production hours"" are mainly due to the poor situation in the cargo sector. The DB subsidiary has been in the red for years and risks being put up for sale under pressure from the EU Commission if there is no improvement. How far the plans of the management go is not known to the unions and works councils. Even within the framework of the ""Restructuring Program S3,"" which aims to cut 30,000 jobs – primarily in administration – within five years, locations could be closed and maintenance orders outsourced abroad. What is clear is that ""the railway management still does not present a plan and is only thinking about cuts,"" said the EVG spokesperson. ""Some of these factories are over 100 years old; grandpa worked there, then the father, now the son. To just shut them down would be a blow to the identity of the regions."" So far, only the closure of the branch in Delitzsch, Saxony, has been decided. ""The factory manager arrived in the morning and said, 'By the end of the year, it's over.'"" At the FZI in Paderborn, it was announced in the spring that no apprentices would be trained anymore. The colleagues on-site are alarmed and expect the worst. As early as March, they demonstrated by the hundreds in front of the factory gates for the preservation of the production site. Protests have already occurred elsewhere as well. Under the motto ""Our factories are worth every fight!"" the EVG showed up on Tuesday with more than 400 railway workers in front of the DB Tower at Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. ""We demand that they finally present us with a future plan for the factory landscape of the railway,"" said the union spokesperson. ""We don't want to be kept in the dark any longer; we're all in the dark, and the colleagues are understandably extremely nervous."" He also raised the question of what will happen once the crisis is over, the economy is back on track, and the railways, as announced by the federal government, will be restructured. ""If, today, you simply throw highly qualified people out the door – who will drive the trains and maintain them tomorrow?"" Well, maybe everything will sort itself out by then: with artificial intelligence and some serious finger-crossing.";center;{'center': 0.814300000667572, 'left': 0.11990000307559967, 'left-center': 0.03269999846816063, 'right': 0.017899999395012856, 'right-center': 0.01510000042617321}

Often, the US has pursued its own interests in recent history through development policy – harshly and in a realpolitik manner, as the research literature now abundantly proves. A clear example of this was provided by former US Secretary of State James Baker, as a threat could hardly have been more direct: ""This is the most expensive vote you’ve ever cast,"" he told the Yemeni ambassador in 1990 by note, after the ambassador had voted against the use of force against Iraq, contrary to the US position. And Baker made good on his threat: The United States cut all of Yemen's development aid of 70 million US dollars and the country was denied IMF loans for six years. Of course, the actions of Trump and Musk against USAID represent a new level of escalation, leading to significant disruptions, especially in global healthcare. And yes: The indifference towards the consequences of this decision shows a new level of ruthlessness in US politics. However, even in the past, development aid was never selfless, as the example of Yemen shows. It was always used as a tool to assert one's own interests and inevitably creates power imbalances between donor and recipient states. The ""policy of equality"" often invoked in liberal circles is at most a lip service. For such a policy, different levers would need to be set in motion – such as a reform of the international monetary and financial architecture. But the industrialized countries are opposed to this. The imbalance is particularly evident at the International Monetary Fund (IMF): Although the industrialized nations make up only 13.7 percent of the global population, they hold 59 percent of the voting rights. The United States even has a veto right. The remaining 86.3 percent of the global population must settle for 41 percent of the voting rights – even though it is primarily the countries of the Global South that are most affected by the market-liberal programs of the IMF. In multilateral development organizations, industrialized nations insist on maintaining control over the economic policies of countries in the Global South. In bilateral development aid, the level of control is even greater – and donor countries use development aid to buy political favors. This so-called ""aid as a means to an end"" has a long tradition. For example, following decolonization in the 1950s and 60s, a race began between the superpowers for political influence and access to raw materials in Africa. Development aid played a central role in this. In many cases, the US and the Soviet Union kept authoritarian regimes alive that would not have survived without their financial support. At the United Nations, the industrialized nations use development aid as leverage to secure votes. Although resolutions of the General Assembly are not legally binding, their symbolic weight should not be underestimated – the larger the majority a country can gather for its position, the better. And although all countries use development policy to assert their own interests, nowhere is the idea of ""deal-making"" as pronounced as in the United States: Since the 1980s, there has even been a law requiring the US State Department to report on how countries vote in the General Assembly if the issues in question are relevant to US interests. USAID must take this voting behavior into account when allocating aid. Agreement in the General Assembly is financially rewarded, while disagreement is punished. A similar logic applies when developing countries temporarily gain greater political influence – such as through one of the ten non-permanent seats on the UN Security Council. Since decisions require a majority of nine of the fifteen votes (without a veto from the five permanent members), there is an incentive to win over as many members as possible. Aid to developing countries increases significantly during their membership in the Security Council – by 59 percent from the US, for example. Conversely, countries can face financial penalties if they oppose the US – and if necessary, the IMF can be called upon. Yemen is not the only country to experience this. After Zimbabwe gained a seat on the UN Security Council in 1990 and refused to support a US resolution against Iraq, the country was threatened with tightened conditions for the next IMF loan installments. Zimbabwe then supported eleven US resolutions against Iraq in the Security Council. Likewise, IMF loans to US allies in the past came with fewer conditions than loans to non-allied countries. The same can empirically be said for loans and projects from the World Bank. Furthermore, multilateral institutions are often used as ""covert development aid"" when support through bilateral aid cannot be politically justified. An example: At the end of the 1970s, Bangladesh began voting more frequently against US positions in the General Assembly, so expanding development aid would have caught the attention of Congress. However, since Bangladesh was also represented on the Security Council, and the US relied on support for important resolutions – such as Resolution 457 in December 1979, which called on Iran to release American hostages – the decline in bilateral development aid was compensated by an increase in multilateral loans. IMF loan commitments, which had been zero in 1978, rose to up to 400 million US dollars by 1980. World Bank funds also more than doubled: from 156 million US dollars in 1978 to 417 million US dollars in 1980. When Donald Trump, together with Elon Musk, now slashes development aid, it does not signify a departure from a previously selfless practice. Development aid has always been a tool for pursuing political interests and forming strategic alliances. The closure of USAID may also have a stronger domestic signal and satisfy MAGA fanatics (and domestic political effects may currently outweigh foreign policy considerations). However, one can be sure that the US will continue to use its financial power (and if necessary, the military) wherever it has interests to pursue. This is likely to remain the standard practice even after Trump's presidency, albeit with more structure and order.";left;{'center': 0.25859999656677246, 'left': 0.6638000011444092, 'left-center': 0.0414000004529953, 'right': 0.0210999995470047, 'right-center': 0.01510000042617321}
So wollen die Grünen AfD-Politikern die Grundrechte entziehen;Junge Freiheit;<a href='https://jungefreiheit.de/politik/deutschland/2025/so-wollen-die-gruenen-afd-politikern-die-grundrechte-entziehen/' target='_blank'>So wollen die Grünen AfD-Politikern die Grundrechte entziehen</a>;"SAARBRÜCKEN. The Saarland state chapter has called at its party conference for the revocation of basic rights for leading AfD politicians. The background is an urgent motion titled ""Upgrading the AfD – Time to Act!"", which targets the application of Article 18 of the Basic Law. According to this, leading AfD members such as Björn Höcke and Maximilian Krah should be deprived of basic rights like the active and passive right to vote, as well as the ability to hold public office. Article 18 of the Basic Law allows this step if basic rights are ""abused for the fight against the free democratic basic order."" To date, this provision has never been applied in the history of the Federal Republic. The Greens justify their position with the hopelessness of a party ban procedure, which would be difficult to enforce. The revocation of basic rights, according to the Saarland Greens, should therefore serve as a tool to prevent the AfD's participation in governments or public offices. Anyone opposing this would be complicit in the ""erosion of our liberal democracy,"" according to a statement referring to the state chairman Volker Morbe.

The AfD had been classified as ""securely right-wing extremist"" by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution shortly before the resignation of Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD). The corresponding report was supposed to remain confidential, but it was published by JUNGE FREIHEIT, Cicero, and Nius. Until a judicial clarification, the office has committed to continuing to treat the party ""only"" as a suspected case. Despite these circumstances, the Greens in Saarland continue to demand the initiation of an AfD ban procedure and call on local politicians to refrain from any cooperation with the party – regardless of the specific circumstances.

First decisions should be made before the summer holidays, said Chancellor and CDU leader Friedrich Merz after the first meeting of the coalition committee. Some measures could become law by July. ""It will now happen quickly,"" he promised. The Union and the SPD had already announced relief and reforms, which were now discussed and prioritized in the coalition committee. However, the coalition leaders left open which of the many initiatives could actually be passed before the summer break. They did agree on a list with several dozen points that are considered ""priority."" However, most of the projects and measures are not yet backed by specific data. In the joint press conference with Merz, the party leaders of the SPD and CSU, Lars Klingbeil and Markus Söder, also emphasized that implementation should proceed quickly. Söder said it should already be visible from the summer onwards that Germany would become a different country. ""Everyone should quickly see improvements in everyday life, in their profession, in every region,"" said Vice Chancellor Klingbeil. Merz was later asked again what points could be implemented by the summer. His response: In the coalition agreement, the CDU, CSU, and SPD had already made it clear which areas they attach special importance to: At the top of the list is the chapter ""New Economic Growth, Good Jobs, Joint Effort."" ""This government was elected for four years and intends to work for four years. But we do, of course, have some problems that we want to solve quickly and must solve quickly,"" Merz said in the press conference after the coalition committee meeting. ""This mainly includes overcoming the weakness in economic growth. We are now in the third year of a recession, and we want to get out of it as quickly as possible."" Merz mentioned measures such as better tax depreciation opportunities for investments, less bureaucracy, and laws to implement the planned, credit-financed special fund of 500 billion euros for more investments in infrastructure and climate protection. As a central measure, the coalition wants to introduce an ""investment booster"" in the form of so-called declining depreciation. This is intended to encourage companies to invest more – for example, in new facilities. Currently, companies are holding back on investments. Only a few points in the ""immediate program"" have concrete dates for implementation. The 1st of January 2026 is mentioned for the reduction of VAT for the hospitality sector, the increase in the commuter allowance, and the reintroduction of full agricultural diesel reimbursement for farmers. One point that will not be implemented quickly is the reform of the Bürgergeld (citizen's income), which the coalition wants to replace with a new basic income system. This is a ""relatively complex legislative process,"" said Merz. The Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, Bärbel Bas, has to work carefully on this. ""We don’t want to make a hasty decision that will later require revisions,"" said Merz. The responsible minister for labour and social affairs is the SPD politician Bärbel Bas. For many measures, however, the federal government depends on the approval of the states. And there is significant resistance from the states, especially against two proposals: the increase in the commuter allowance and the reduction of VAT in the hospitality sector. They fear that these tax plans could lead to billions in lost revenue for them as well. Both Merz, Söder, and Klingbeil made it clear that, where necessary, they will rely on the approval of the states in the Bundesrat. All party leaders spoke of an exceptionally good atmosphere in the discussions. ""It makes us excited for more and gives hope for success,"" said Söder. The coalition committee, as the central planning body of the coalition, is supposed to meet at least once a month on issues of ""fundamental importance,"" according to the coalition agreement. The committee, which includes the party leaders, consists of ten men and only one woman, which has sparked considerable criticism.";center;{'center': 0.7512000203132629, 'left': 0.16329999268054962, 'left-center': 0.047600001096725464, 'right': 0.021800000220537186, 'right-center': 0.016100000590085983}
Treffsicherer Rechtsexperte;nd;<a href='https://www.nd-aktuell.de/artikel/1191561.thomas-fischer-treffsicherer-rechtsexperte.html' target='_blank'>Treffsicherer Rechtsexperte</a>;"Thomas Fischer holds both a doctoral and professorial title and is a ubiquitous expert in German law – and beyond. In his latest column for Spiegel Online, he criticizes Israel’s actions in the Gaza War. Fischer argues that the government ""has long since crossed every limit of proportionality"" and is using hunger as a means of warfare against the civilian population. The population is being ""driven back and forth like rats in a cage, terrorized, and cut off from essential supplies."" This wording is particularly disliked by those who, even after tens of thousands of civilian deaths – including many children and young people – and 19 months of war, still speak of Israel’s ""self-defense"" as being necessary. The Jüdische Allgemeine newspaper labeled Fischer’s well-informed (and Karl Marx-quoting) criticism of Israel as self-righteousness. However, the poorly written piece contains hardly any arguments – instead, it is full of accusations and insinuations.

Fischer, born in 1953 and raised in the northwest of Sauerland, was, after his high school graduation and subsequent refusal to serve in the military, appointed to be a criminal law professor, first by the presiding judge at the Federal Court of Justice in Bavaria. He also worked as a Ministerial Director at the Saxon Ministry of Justice, where he led a department responsible for the criminal prosecution of the SED regime. Fischer is particularly known in the legal community as the editor of the standard commentary on the German Penal Code. Since 2017, he has been retired early but continues to work for a law firm and as an honorary professor at the University of Würzburg, in addition to writing combative columns. He is allegedly also a member of Amnesty International. Nevertheless, Fischer supported the idea in 2023 that climate activists who glue themselves to streets should receive prison sentences without parole.

In the Jüdische Allgemeine, which is published by the Central Council of Jews, it is not made clear where Fischer might have gone wrong in his column. His demand that Germany and Europe should confront the Israeli government more decisively has sparked controversy – a step that was taken this week, when (CDU) stated that Israel’s attacks on the civilian population could ""no longer be justified by the fight against Hamas terrorism.""

The German debate about the Gaza War is thus on the move. Even the brief online backlash that followed Jüdische Allgemeine's report on Fischer cannot prevent this.";center;{'center': 0.5493000149726868, 'left': 0.3546999990940094, 'left-center': 0.05620000138878822, 'right': 0.023099999874830246, 'right-center': 0.016699999570846558}
Gericht stoppt Trump Zollpolitik;taz;<a href='https://taz.de/US-Handelspolitik-unter-Donald-Trump/!6090884/' target='_blank'>Gericht stoppt Trump Zollpolitik</a>;"Washington taz | The U.S. Federal Court in New York, responsible for international trade, has declared a large portion of the tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump to be unlawful.

On Wednesday, the judges decided that Trump had overstepped his authority with his tariff policy. Trade tariffs are the responsibility of the U.S. Congress, and only in national emergencies can a president impose tariffs unilaterally. Several trade associations and 12 states had filed lawsuits.

The tariffs that Trump introduced to the public in early April were based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The law, enacted in 1977, grants the president broad authority to take control of the country’s international trade and economic relations in the event of a threat to national security, foreign policy, or the economy. However, no president had ever imposed trade tariffs under this law before – it was originally designed for sanctions and embargo measures. Trump had argued that the U.S.'s long-standing trade deficit constituted a national emergency.

The judges, however, ruled that this was not a national emergency and that the tariffs imposed by Trump were therefore unlawful. ""The worldwide and reciprocal tariff regulations exceed any authority granted to the president by the IEEPA,"" the court’s written decision stated. The judges further explained that the Constitution explicitly assigns tariff authority to Congress, and that the IEEPA does not grant the president unrestricted authority to make such decisions even in emergencies. The law only empowers the president to impose economic sanctions ""to address an unusual and extraordinary threat,"" the court documents added.

In the case of the tariffs imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico, which the U.S. government claimed were in response to illegal drug smuggling, the judges declared these tariffs to be unlawful ""because they do not address the threats outlined in these orders."" The judges saw no clear connection between tariffs and stopping the flow of illegal drugs, particularly fentanyl. Trump had argued that tariffs of 25% on Mexican and Canadian products and 10% on Chinese products were necessary to pressure these countries to combat drug smuggling into the U.S. more effectively.

""Imposing tariffs on legal imports is obviously not related to efforts by foreign governments to arrest, detain, or otherwise intercept wrongdoers in their respective jurisdictions,"" the judges wrote.

The White House immediately filed an appeal. A government spokesperson stated that the trade deficits, which the reciprocal tariffs and others are meant to address, indeed represent a national emergency. ""These deficits have created a national emergency that has weakened American communities, left our workers behind, and weakened our industrial defense base – facts that the court did not dispute. ... It is not the job of unelected judges to decide how a national emergency should be appropriately handled,"" said government spokesperson Kush Desai in a statement.

Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller referred to the ruling as a ""judicial coup."" Oregon's Attorney General, Dan Rayfield, however, called the decision a victory for working families, small business owners, and all Americans. ""President Trump's sweeping tariffs were illegal, reckless, and economically devastating. ... They triggered retaliatory measures, drove up prices on essential goods, and burdened American families, small businesses, and manufacturers unjustly,"" Rayfield said in a statement.

Although the court's decision has temporarily blocked most of Trump’s tariffs, other tariffs that do not rely on the IEEPA as a legal basis remain in place. These include tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as well as foreign vehicles.";center;{'center': 0.6909999847412109, 'left': 0.12269999831914902, 'left-center': 0.15770000219345093, 'right': 0.011800000444054604, 'right-center': 0.01679999940097332}
Vorhang auf! Das neue Berliner Theaterstück nimmt seinen Lauf;Tichys Einblick;<a href='https://www.tichyseinblick.de/tichys-einblick/merz-kabinett-politikwende/' target='_blank'>Vorhang auf! Das neue Berliner Theaterstück nimmt seinen Lauf</a>;"We should wish Friedrich Merz and his cabinet the best of luck and success in government. Whether we like it or not, if he fails to achieve any of the things he has set out to do as the remnants of a political turnaround, we will all pay the bill as citizens and taxpayers. Another three or four years of the traffic light mess would be almost unbearable; security, peace, prosperity and freedom are now too endangered. Things have to get better. The ball is round and the game lasts 90 minutes - that's true in soccer, in politics it lasts until the next election. During this time, we cheer every goal, rejoice at every successful political move and criticize every failure. The game begins. Whoever governs creates facts far below the law. In future, the decision as to which “non-governmental organization” will receive money from the state coffers to support government policy will be made in the Chancellery and no longer in the Ministry of Family Affairs: this will certainly increase the CDU's chances of no longer being fought with bought demonstrations. Foreign Minister Johann Wadenphul visits families of Hamas hostages. Will this finally put an end to the hidden green financing of Hamas? These are important decisions. Whoever governs has real power. But who really governs? Coalition governments are doomed to compromise. This can even be helpful because compromises prevent radical solutions, which are all too often ill-considered because the consequences cannot be thought through to the end. Great Britain, which does not need a coalition with its majority voting system, is not always a good example: socialist phases under Labour with disastrous consequences were followed by Conservative governments, which corrected some things and in turn committed exaggerations. However, Merz has tied lead to his own leg because the coalition agreement contains too much socialist line and green arrogance. This is a bad start, which also discourages his own team: Abandoning the debt brake is economically unreasonable because Merz was right when he said that today's debts are tomorrow's taxes. And that a government that distributes practically unlimited amounts of money in order to maintain coalition peace and avoid conflicts will hardly stimulate growth. Many CDU voters and members are frustrated and have inwardly resigned. Their principles are being burned in the bonfire of the coalition. The CDU/CSU has not chained itself to the red-red-green camp for better or worse. And so it is with many positions in the coalition agreement. It does not facilitate government action, but rather drives it towards the structural conservatism of the red-green traffic light. At some points, Merz seems determined to govern against the coalition agreement. Can he be successful? Because the others are also governing - in their own way. No, we are not judging him by his first 3 or 4 days in government. But they already show the predicament he has maneuvered himself into. Closing the borders to illegal migrants is the right goal. But it overlooks the main causes of the disaster that Angela Merkel has created and left behind. Anyone who reaches a German border post and can pronounce the word asylum is more than 95 percent likely to be able to stay in Germany with a permanent right of residence and soon apply for a German passport - without learning a single word of German or working a single day. They will nevertheless be provided for in the best possible way, even without any action on their part - and with family reunification, they will receive the same full care. This attracts people; and who should stay in Greece, where there is no such luxury? Or in Poland, where work is demanded? Or in Hungary, where camps near the border are a threat? It is the German level of unlimited full provision that acts like a magnet on people, who naturally move to where it is best for them. Stopping this migration to the promised welfare office requires a fundamental decision. The right thing to do would be to turn off the magnet and tighten and support controls at the EU's external borders. Instead, he has massively annoyed his European partners and other countries that have the misfortune of being on the migration route to Germany in recent years with his solo efforts and hyper-moralistic behavior. Greece and Italy have been reprimanded and lectured in a manner that is sometimes unbearable and reminiscent of even more unpleasant times. Hungary was even deprived of EU funds because of this. After all, it is German taxpayers' money that is being used to finance the transportation of refugees across the Mediterranean to Italy. Many people rightly say: “You take them, then keep them.” You can't really change that with a few extra federal police officers. And this is where the big difficulty lurks: the SPD.Even in the first 3 days of the Merz government, Sonja Eichwede, deputy leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag, And even the new CDU foreign minister Johann Wadephul made it clear in the semi-official that the new federal government would not pursue its migration policy against the will of Poland's Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is alone with his position, just as after 2015 the then Interior Minister Horst Seehofer failed Merkel with his migration restriction policy and had to dismiss his department head Hans-Georg Maaßen, who formulated the hard line. Welcome to the club, Mr. Dobrindt. What's going on here is a show event. Not anymore. Yes, this government is swimming in money, which it borrows at the expense of the citizens. But a certain Lars Klingbeil, SPD, decides on financial policy. And like Merz, he will govern in his own, left-wing way. There are many hints in the coalition agreement: Every citizen and every merchant will be monitored even more closely; money laundering and terrorist financing will serve as a pretext to have every transfer of more than 10,000 euros checked by a new super authority in Frankfurt and, in case of doubt, confiscated.  Cash is being tacitly pushed back. Anyone who pays for everything cashlessly will be able to disclose what they spend money on, where they spend it and how much. Each of us will become a beacon on the radar screen of total surveillance. Will Merz defend the remnants of civil liberties against the state and greedy corporations? He may like to or want to, but Lars Klingbeil stands in the way of his ability. And one thing is certain: Klingbeil will not provide the urgently needed relief for taxpayers and the economy. The government's share is more likely to exceed the already close to 50 percent hurdle instead of being reduced. The health, pension and long-term care insurance schemes are going through periods of immense financial hardship. Yes, this is partly due to demographics; unborn children do not pay contributions. No promises will help if the money is not there. Work is becoming unaffordable in Germany. Non-wage labor costs are rising; together with employee contributions, they amount to around 40 percent. Neither the former Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Hubertus Heil nor former Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach have introduced any measures to counteract this - a repression of the problem in office that is now falling on the feet of the new government. The new Social Affairs Minister Bärbel Bas (SPD) is already demanding: “Civil servants, members of parliament and the self-employed should also pay into the pension insurance scheme. .”  One suspects that it will be particularly expensive for the self-employed. The new Minister for Economic Affairs, Katherina Reiche, is right to rid her ministry of the family members and members by marriage, the backers and legacies of the thieving Graichen clan, who distributed tax money among themselves and NGOs, which in turn were run by family members. Katherina Reiche is also ridding the house of green ideologues in energy policy. She was previously Secretary of State and headed the Association of Municipal Enterprises (VKU) and the E.ON subsidiary Westenergie. Unusual for German politicians: she has a clue. That's nice. Bravo. Applause right at the start of the scene. But her opponent is the Ministry of the Environment. It wields a sharp weapon that was also forged and sharpened in the coalition agreement: Everything must have a climate-neutral effect, which will be written into the Basic Law in future. This is a brutal veto right. This sword can be used to decapitate any pro-business measure even before it has been conceived and formulated. Please take care of your integrity, Ms. Reiche, because you have a clever mind. One thing is clear: energy costs remain absurdly high in Germany. But what can you do with an office apart from making speeches while power-conscious socialists use the powers? That also applies to bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is unfortunately an unavoidable part of every organization and administration. But state bureaucracy is more: it is the instrument of power with which the state draws power to itself and exercises rule, degrading citizens to subjects. Bureaucratic regulations are the many small, thin threads with which Gulliver is ultimately tied up. Socialists know this, whose instrument of rule - alongside a powerful secret service - is the all-powerful bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is the concrete implementation of centralized rule that wants to determine everything, and the traffic lights have demonstrated this: What we eat, whether meaty or vegan, how we heat, how we insulate, how we do business, what we invest in and what products we are allowed to produce and consume. Bureaucracy is coagulated socialism. It is not an annoying by-product, it is intentional. And Merz's creation of yet another, 18th ministry instead of abolishing superfluous ministries sends exactly the wrong signal. Grandiose headlines are followed by the daily grind of bureaucratic tutelage and paternalism. Ludwig Erhard knew this and used regulatory policy to set narrow limits on bureaucracy, drawing a dividing line between the state and the economy and limiting himself to framework conditions. But that has been forgotten, the memory of Erhard has been museumized and thus defused; it takes place in airtight showcases and doddering memorial events, but no longer in life. Friedrich Merz has not triggered the optimism that usually goes hand in hand with the magic of a new beginning. People are suspicious and dismissive. The fact that he organized his election with the help of the anti-freedom and anti-prosperity LEFT and tore down the firewall in this direction will have consequences: The left-wing camp is now in power, and the LINKE is part of it. , rejoices its chairman Jan van Aken. It is undoubtedly the case that the voters have chosen a bourgeois-right policy and have received a red-green policy in black paint. The democracy-disrespecting saying that if elections could change anything, they would already be banned is at least partially confirmed in a spooky way.  “It is detrimental to our liberal state if, in the long term, only center-left governments come into office, while the majority of the population votes for parties of the center or the right,” writes political scientist Werner Patzelt. He has published an authoritative book on the “blue wonder” AfD, in which he critically but fairly traces the development of the party and comes to the conclusion that the attempt to completely exclude the largest opposition party, its voters and actual or supposed supporters from politics and people from as many social backgrounds as possible is damaging this country and, incidentally, draining the CDU: its firewall policy has only made the AfD even stronger and weakened the CDU, even leading it into a kind of “Babylonian captivity” with the left-wing camp. It is not the AfD that is the problem, but the fact that the obvious grievances such as migration and economic policy are not being addressed. Demonstrations that are co-financed by the state coffers and perform ridiculous acts such as “grannies against the right” or “rock against the right” don't help either: Roaring confessional rage and political fantasizing of a right-wing coup is not only far removed from any reality, but has only helped the AfD.  “Then I'm just on the right” is the shrugging response to the insane exaggerations and demonizations that block any critical examination of one's own position as well as that of the AfD. But a country simply cannot be governed against a quarter or a third of the population, no matter how anti-democratically the domestic secret service is armed to combat opponents. And Friedrich Merz and his party friends are caught in this trap: there is no state to be made with the radical left and red-green repressors of reality and no political turnaround, such attempts remain state theater. And they fear failure even before the curtain rises. Even congratulations at the beginning will probably not help much.";left;{'center': 0.4311999976634979, 'left': 0.4641000032424927, 'left-center': 0.0674000009894371, 'right': 0.021199999377131462, 'right-center': 0.016100000590085983}

The OA was very convincing for us due to its binding, class-oriented and grassroots approach to organizing. We did not want to remain isolated, but wanted to become part of a supra-regional organization that would lead concrete struggles on the ground and at the same time work on building counter-power to overcome the existing conditions. The OA combines everyday political struggles with a long-term strategic orientation. In a small town like Schwäbisch Gmünd, there is a lack of traditional left-wing infrastructure. This opens up other possibilities. Because the space is narrower, political action is immediately noticeable. This presents both opportunities and risks. But what OA stands for works everywhere: whether in Nuremberg, Stuttgart or Schwäbisch Gmünd. We are also convinced that - to paraphrase Clara Zetkin - we have to fight where life is, where we learn and live. Because that's where people feel the everyday effects of exploitation, oppression and crises, so that's where we have to start and organize resistance. We do this in different ways: in women's self-organization, where sexism and patriarchy are addressed and combated; in youth groups or in anti-fascist initiatives that take action against racism, right-wing politics and their social basis. Especially in small towns, the establishment of premises is of central importance. They serve as meeting points and places of political organization. They make left-wing politics tangible in everyday life and offer people the opportunity to organize collectively beyond isolation and powerlessness. We, and the Schwäbisch Gmünd Women's Initiative in particular, wanted to make it clear that anti-feminist and reactionary ideologies have no place here. The so-called “Leben.Würde” congress brought together Christian fundamentalist and right-wing conservative actors who specifically attack self-determination. Our demonstration was a clear signal against this rollback. Over 300 people responded to the call. Conservative networks feel safe in the provinces because they can often operate undisturbed here and enjoy a certain amount of support from the church and local politicians. The “protection of life” discourse often serves as a cover for generally anti-feminist, authoritarian and reactionary politics. This was also the case at the congress. Mobilization and participation in the demonstration have shown: Even in the “provinces” there are many people who are not prepared to stand idly by and watch reactionary developments. Although existing contradictions in small towns are concealed by more direct social relationships, they are just as present. And thus also the potential for protest. That is why it is important to be present there too, not just with one-off interventions, but to build up structures of solidarity in the long term. If you want to change conditions, you have to start everywhere, even in the supposedly provincial areas. links & bündig gegen rechte Bünde Subscribe to the free jW newsletter now - the best of the daily newspaper junge Welt, straight to your inbox every day.

Nein, die Menschen in Deutschland arbeiten nicht zu wenig;Jacobin;<a href='https://www.jacobin.de/artikel/merz-wirtschaft-arbeit-gewerkschaften-agenda2010-arbeitszeit-teilzeit-klassenkampf' target='_blank'>Nein, die Menschen in Deutschland arbeiten nicht zu wenig</a>;"People in Germany are working too little - at least that's what Friedrich Merz believes. As his first official act, the Chancellor called on the population to make tough cuts that are necessary to boost the economy. “We need to work more and, above all, more efficiently in this country,” he demanded. With a four-day week and work-life balance, prosperity could no longer be maintained. He promptly received support for this assertion from the employer-affiliated ), which published an evaluation a few days later that purports to prove that Merz is right. Compared to other OECD countries, Germans work too little and for too short a time - even less than the Greeks, the IW claims indignantly. The whole thing is accompanied by a veritable media campaign aimed at increasing the pressure on employees in this country. The newspaper, for example, wishes: “The Merz agenda could do with a good shot of the former chancellor's Agenda 2010.” The paper would also like to see a return to the brutal labor market reforms of the Agenda years: Merz should “shake up the Germans like Gerhard Schröder once did”. However, there is no need for Merz to take Schröder as a role model - he has obviously long seen himself in the tradition of the former chancellor. When Schröder made his government statement in 2003 before implementing the Agenda policy, he called for a “tremendous joint effort” to boost economic growth. Merz was a member of the Bundestag at the time and seems to have remembered this very well, because today he repeats it almost word for word: he demands a “tremendous effort” from the population. So in order to increase the gross national product, we have to roll up our sleeves. The parallels continue. Back then, the German economy was also in a growth crisis, which was to be broken up by Schröder's offensive against his own base. In order to encourage entrepreneurs to invest in the German economy, everything was made as business-friendly as possible. Schröder also wanted to drastically reduce the taxes that companies pay on their profits, just like Friedrich Merz does today. And then, as now, the whole thing was flanked by cuts in social spending. The fact that Friedrich Merz believes that people in Germany do not work hard enough proves above all that he does not know what everyday working life is like for most people in this country. First of all, it should be noted that the claim that employees in Germany are working less than in the past is based on one thing. It is true that the usual weekly working time is “only” 34.4 hours. However, this figure refers to all people in employment. If you exclude people who work part-time or are self-employed, it becomes clear that the working hours of full-time employees have remained almost constant since 1991: 41.4 hours per week back then, 40.2 hours today. The fact that working hours are declining on average therefore has less to do with people holding their work-life balance sacred than with the fact that people - especially women - who were previously not part of the workforce have been integrated into the labor market. An international comparison shows that Germany now has one of the highest employment rates in the world, which is also a result of part-time employment: its share has increased since 1991. The massive increase in part-time employment is pulling down the average number of hours worked - but the total volume of work has increased over the years: in 2023, more people worked in Germany than at any time since reunification. Almost every second person works part-time - not out of laziness, but because they are caring for either young and/or old people. Instead of expanding the care infrastructure in this country to provide support, it is being run down even further. The fact that it is predominantly women who are so overrepresented among part-time workers is also due to the fact that women's participation in the workforce has risen dramatically over the past two decades, while the division of labor within the home has hardly shifted between the sexes, as (DIW) shows. Those who work part-time often do not work less in principle, but simply tend to do more work that is not remunerated. The fact that Friedrich Merz's government has now also decided to create tax incentives for more overtime and to soften the maximum daily working hours, according to the coalition agreement, should not only be seen as a frontal attack on the 8-hour day. Because if nothing is done at the same time to expand childcare and
care for the elderly at the same time, this is likely to exacerbate the existing gap between men and women. After all, someone will have to look after the sick granny at home if the other person is stuck in the office until late at night. The fact that working people in Germany are lazy does not stand up to further empirical surveys. Unpaid work takes place not only in the private sphere, but also in the workplace. of employees regularly work more than contractually agreed - and often unpaid. This lowers the effective hourly wage and increases company profits. Last year, employees in this country worked so much overtime that 750,000 full-time positions could have been filled. The fact that so much work is being done over and above the agreed working hours shows, above all, that the workload is becoming more concentrated and stress levels are rising. When Friedrich Merz demands “a huge effort” from all of us, he is closing his eyes to this reality. The claim that the stagnating economic growth is due to the supposed laziness of working people is not only unrealistic, it is also rhetorical trickery. When Schröder implemented Agenda 2010, he also claimed that people simply had to be “activated” and motivated to work more. At the same time, there were fewer job vacancies than people looking for work. At the time, unemployment was at an all-time high of around 12% and there were significantly fewer unfilled vacancies than people without work. Today, the labor market is less tight and unemployment is significantly lower. Nevertheless, there are fewer than unemployed people. In other words, you can't force people into jobs that don't exist. An economy that stagnates does not create new jobs. What's more, jobs often remain unfilled because applicants lack the relevant training. Instead of investing in training and further education, Merz is taking a leaf out of Schröder's book here too. Today, “placement priority” is once again being prioritized, which means nothing other than effectively forcing people into the next best precarious scrap job by tightening sanctions and reasonableness regulations. Furthermore, the fact that workers are sought and not found is not the result of a lack of motivation, but also the consequence of adverse working conditions and low wages - Merz is also deliberately silent about this. When he talks about working “more and more effectively”, he ignores the fact that the workload in many sectors with a shortage of skilled workers is already too high. This is precisely why there is such a shortage of staff. Many sectors that are particularly affected - care and health, schools and daycare centers, trades and gastronomy - are notoriously understaffed, wages are often low, working hours are long and time pressure is immense. Many leave these professions completely burnt out. Instead of improving conditions and wages and making the work more attractive in order to attract more people to it, the upcoming government is relying on thumb screws. What Merz is proposing means in plain language: more pressure and less social security for employees, more profits for companies. By telling the population that economic stagnation can be solved by simply working longer and harder, the causes of the shortage of skilled workers and a struggling economy are being completely ignored. The narrative of the supposedly lazy workforce in this country is one thing above all: an attack from above. What's more, one in three companies is planning to close down in the course of this year and the economy is stumbling. The fewer jobs are available, the more willingly people who are forced to sell their labor will submit to the demands of their employers. The bargaining position of employers on the labor market is already strong. The lie of a lazy population as the reason why this economy does not create growth is not only a distorted picture that is far removed from reality, it is also nothing new. Growth crises are a familiar feature of capitalism, they are practically part of the system. With the beginning of the neoliberal era, attempts were also made in the past to combat stagnation and unemployment by loosening labor protection, reducing regulations and giving companies more freedom while tightening economic constraints on the population. This orchestrated class war, which made the broad majority more vulnerable to corporate interests, was supposed to be the price that had to be paid for more growth and economic recovery - now they are spitting in their hands again. But the economic boom never came. Why it should be different this time is written in the stars. What is certain, however, is that this policy is shifting the balance of power in society to the disadvantage of working people. Friedrich Merz's appeal to the population to work more again is therefore only superficially about economic recovery. In particular, it is also about weakening the bargaining power on the labor market to such an extent that people are increasingly willing to accept any job, as state support is being reduced at the same time. We should call a spade a spade: Friedrich Merz's policy is not a policy for economic recovery, but a policy of discipline.";center;{'center': 0.7437000274658203, 'left': 0.1729000061750412, 'left-center': 0.04989999905228615, 'right': 0.01940000057220459, 'right-center': 0.0142000000923872}

The introduction of the payment card for asylum seekers has shown. In several federal states, the number of voluntary departures has risen significantly - in places where the new payment card was introduced with strict cash limits and transfer bans. In Bavaria, for example, where the card has been in use since spring 2024, the number of departures rose by 30 percent between July and December - from 5,984 (2023) to 7,778 (2024) - according to a survey conducted by the -Zeitung. The situation is similar in Thuringia: In the Saale-Orla district, the number of voluntary departures almost tripled from 31 to 90. Greiz (Thuringia), which pioneered the introduction in December 2023, recorded a 28% increase in departures in 2024. At the same time, the number of asylum seekers who took up full-time employment there increased by 30 percent. Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony and Magdeburg have also reported rising numbers of departures since the card was introduced. Particularly noteworthy: in Brandenburg, there was more than a doubling (from 154 to 371 cases). It is unclear where the migrants are moving to. Moving within Germany is generally not permitted without official approval. Fingerprints and photos at the initial reception are intended to prevent multiple registrations. In the north of Germany, where the cards are issued with fewer restrictions, the trend is stagnating - or even reversing: In Hanover, where social cards were even distributed without cash limits and transfer restrictions, the number of departures fell by 36 percent year-on-year (from 285 to 181). In Hamburg, the number of departures also remained virtually unchanged (616 and 618 cases respectively). You are currently viewing placeholder content from .

Welche Prioritäten die Regierung setzen will;tagesschau;<a href='https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/innenpolitik/sofortprogramm-bundesregierung-102.html' target='_blank'>Welche Prioritäten die Regierung setzen will</a>;The coalition partners CDU, CSU and SPD state that investment should become simpler, faster and less bureaucratic. To this end, revisions to planning, construction, environmental, procurement and procedural law are to be implemented “by the summer” - from procurement for the German Armed Forces to the expansion of renewable energies and notarizations with notaries to fertilizer regulations in agriculture. The coalition's investments also include the law establishing the 500 billion euro special fund for infrastructure and climate neutrality financed by new debt. According to earlier statements from the Ministry of Finance, this is to be presented to the cabinet on June 25 together with the draft budget for 2025. The law on the federal states' 100 billion share is also set to be passed, as is the “investment booster” with depreciation of 30 percent for 2025, 2026 and 2027 on so-called equipment investments, such as new machinery, equipment and vehicles. In addition, the reduction in corporate tax from 2028 is to be decided in five steps of one percentage point each. “It can all be done in one law,” said Merz. Under this heading, the parties summarize a wider range of projects from curbing migration to the digitalization of administration. The list also includes changes to better combat illegal employment, more investigative powers for the police and easier shooting of wolves to protect grazing animals such as sheep. The coalition's migration plans include legislative proposals such as the suspension of family reunification for certain refugees and the abolition of so-called “turbo naturalizations”, which the cabinet . Newly arrived Ukrainian refugees are no longer to receive a citizen's allowance, but the lower benefits for asylum seekers. Several reforms are to be introduced to boost the economy after two years of weakness. “We are therefore lowering energy costs, reducing taxes for households and companies and removing bureaucratic hurdles,” the paper states. The list includes projects from the coalition agreement such as a reduction in VAT on food in restaurants, tax incentives for electric cars, more flexible working hours and a reduction in electricity tax. Several projects are intended to strengthen cohesion. The list includes incentives for more collective agreements in the economy, the extension of the rent freeze initiated by the cabinet and the appointment of a commission for a new reform of the right to vote in the Bundestag. The “start of a major pension reform” with several components is also mentioned. According to CSU leader Markus Söder, the coalition wants to bundle its plans for pension insurance “in a major pension package”. This is to include the expansion of the mothers' pension as well as securing a pension level of at least 48%, but also tax benefits for employees working beyond retirement age - as well as the early start pension as a savings program for children.;center;{'center': 0.8381999731063843, 'left': 0.09040000289678574, 'left-center': 0.04089999943971634, 'right': 0.016200000420212746, 'right-center': 0.014299999922513962}
Nur symbolisch wertvoll;taz;<a href='https://taz.de/Klima-Urteil-des-OLG-Hamm/!6090901/' target='_blank'>Nur symbolisch wertvoll</a>;The plaintiffs are cheering, even though they have lost. The Peruvian miner Saúl Luciano Lliuya will not receive a cent from the German energy company RWE. However, the Hamm Higher Regional Court has accepted such global civil climate lawsuits against German companies in principle. Someone whose property is genuinely threatened by climate change simply has to sue. Are the climate activists right to celebrate? Will many similar lawsuits follow? There is great doubt about that. If Lliuya's lawsuit had been successful, RWE would only have had to pay 0.38 percent of the costs that the farmer had estimated for protecting his house from a possible flood wave from a glacial lake. This is because RWE is responsible for exactly 0.38 percent of the CO2 emissions caused by industry worldwide. Conversely, this means that the farmer would not have been reimbursed for 99.62 percent of the costs. To make it even clearer: Lliuya calculated 6,000 euros for protective measures on his house. RWE would have had to pay just 22.80 euros of this amount. He could only have sued for the costs of measures on the glacial lake, such as higher dams, if the Peruvian state had charged him directly. The legal dispute over these 22.80 euros dragged on for eight years. There was a site visit in Peru, two costly expert opinions and legal costs of over 800,000 euros, mainly to examine the threat to the house. Added to this were the legal fees of both sides. If the lawsuit had been successful, RWE would have had to bear the costs, but as the example of the mountain farmer shows, you don't know in advance what the results of such reports will be. The risk of legal action is therefore high. The costs are being borne by the Stiftung Zukunftsfähigkeit, which belongs to the NGO Germanwatch. The taz is an independent, left-wing and opinionated daily newspaper. We have been arguing in our commentaries, essays and debates since the taz was founded in 1979. We often cannot and do not want to agree on an opinion. That's why you'll find completely opposing positions here - all part of the very broad left-wing spectrum of opinion. Such complaints are therefore only worthwhile as a means of public relations. They can make it clear that CO2 emissions from German coal and gas-fired power plants have consequences worldwide - as far away as the Peruvian Andes. They do not create individual justice.;center;{'center': 0.7372000217437744, 'left': 0.1500999927520752, 'left-center': 0.08389999717473984, 'right': 0.014600000344216824, 'right-center': 0.014100000262260437}
Arbeitszeit ist Lebenszeit!;nd;<a href='https://www.nd-aktuell.de/artikel/1191562.arbeitszeitdebatte-arbeitszeit-ist-lebenszeit.html' target='_blank'>Arbeitszeit ist Lebenszeit!</a>;"The signs were pointing to a reduction in working hours, which was on everyone's lips in 2024. A new round in the battle of the century for the humanization of work, emancipation from dependent work, gender equality and democratic participation. After the proclamation of the “turn of an era”, the wind is changing. Capital, the government and big media are not squeamish in their fight against this. Daily working hours of more than eight hours would be necessary, and prosperity would not be sustainable with the four-day week and work-life balance. When asked who should work longer, he can't think of much other than pensioners. And, according to Linnemann, the expansion of infrastructure for childcare and nursing could lead to a higher participation of women in the workforce. But what can be done if the economy is not growing - and industrial production cannot grow indefinitely? IG Metall chairwoman Christiane Benner says: “It is the employers who are therefore reducing working hours - at the expense of employees”, in order to reject the demand for a four-day week. In many countries, we are seeing attacks on trade unions and on the lives and health of workers. When the eight-hour day is attacked. What is the right approach? Individual working time organization along the life phases or collective statutory and collectively agreed regulations? How strong is the individual in relation to the employer? Everyone who can no longer stand it or can somehow afford it reduces their working hours. The segmentation into the unemployed, mini-jobs, involuntary part-time and full-time with lots of overtime leads to a division of the working class. A collective reduction in working hours with wage compensation, at least for the lower and middle wage groups, would curb the multiple divisions organized by capital. Time without heteronomy leads to shared time prosperity for parents with children, shared sporting activities and shared care work for women and men. The ongoing battle over working hours is a power-political conflict between two economies: Rationality of the community or business rationality of the individual company (Oskar Negt). In an unleashed capitalism, trade unions must promote international cooperation and sustainable economic activity. The “standard employment relationship” of male, overlong wage labor as the basis for traditional family images is a thing of the past. The duration and location of working hours are core elements of good work. Intensification of work and productivity development require shorter working hours and, if possible, no night work. This is the spirit of the Working Hours Act, Section 1 of which states, among other things: “The purpose of the Act is to ensure the health protection of employees when organizing working hours.” What should be a truism of trade union collective bargaining policy and the socio-political mandate translates little into trade union practice. Trade unions are currently unable to build on the tough, ultimately successful battles for the eight-hour working day, the Saturday off and the 35-hour working week with the socially mobilizing demand for a general reduction in working hours. It has often been described that a reduction in working hours is not a major hurdle in terms of work organization. Large companies can deal with 100 working time models, small companies with ten models and others with many individual implementation agreements. All experience shows that colleagues no longer want to miss out on the luxury of more free time. A winning issue: the offensive against the exclusion of millions of people from society, for a good life for everyone, equal pay and equal time, and for the sustainable use of resources. In essence, it is about power. Hans-Jürgen Urban from the executive board of IG Metall clearly describes this in the “Jahrbuch Gute Arbeit” (2017): “Those who have control over their own time hold the key to an autonomous, self-determined lifestyle. Those who control the time of others exercise foreign domination.”For the trade unions, reducing working hours is programmatic: short full-time working as the new standard and a positive narrative, the statutory restriction of the working week to 40 hours - a task also for Die Linke and its parliamentary group in the Bundestag. This is a winning issue: the offensive against the exclusion of millions of people from society, for a good life for everyone and, as a point of convergence with the climate movement, for the sustainable use of resources. Enforceable in alliances such as the fight for the 35-hour week: young parents, the feminist and care movement, trade unions, social organizations, the environmental and climate movement, scientists, churches, doctors and sports clubs. However, if the trade unions back down, capital will win.

»Wenn alle streiken, wäre es still an der Uni«;Junge Welt;<a href='https://www.jungewelt.de/artikel/500863.prekarisierung-studentischer-arbeit-wenn-alle-streiken-w%C3%A4re-es-still-an-der-uni.html' target='_blank'>»Wenn alle streiken, wäre es still an der Uni«</a>;Student assistants receive an hourly wage of 14.11 euros, those with a Bachelor's degree one euro more. There are fixed-term employment contracts for one year, but often only for four or six months. We recently won the right to work at least ten hours a week. However, in times of rising rents, the cost of living and current inflation, the approximately 530 euros net per month is simply not enough. Even this is often circumvented: Some students have only agreed to five hours, but actually work more. I ask myself: what value does student work have for a university that emphasizes research excellence but systematically refuses fair pay? Chancellor Ulrich Breuer and University President Enrico Schleiff do not want to conclude a collective agreement. We have been demanding it for years. An absurdity: At management level, they receive a five-figure monthly salary, while we are paid just above the minimum wage for our academic work. We supervise tutorials, organize events, correct assignments, relieve administration and teaching. Without student assistants, nothing would work in many places. However, the Presidential Board does not see itself as responsible for providing us with resources. They refer to the individual institutes and they in turn refer to their tight budgets. For us, this means: no fixed workstations, no computers, no software access. We work partly from home and partly at the university. Sometimes eight colleagues sit in one room with two outdated PCs. We have to use our private laptops. If it's broken, that's our problem! This is not a new development. This situation has become even more entrenched in recent years, parallel to the increasing precarization of student employment. We are therefore calling for a transparent budget for digital and analog work equipment. Some simply assume that we use private work equipment - as if this were normal. Others are aware of the problem and are annoyed by the situation. However, almost all of them shy away from open conflict with the university management. This may be due to a lack of time, concerns about their own standing in the institute or because they believe that nothing can be changed anyway. The responsibility lies with the Presidential Board of Goethe University, which must provide the institutes with the necessary funding. They are aware of the problem, but are doing nothing to solve it. We are currently taking stock of the problems. Because of the fixed-term contracts, there is a fear of “standing out unpleasantly” or not getting the job extended. Some hope to make the leap into an academic career via an assistant position. However, many are motivated and want to get involved. If everyone went on strike, it would be quiet at the university. Yes, but many universities are cutting back on their student employees: fixed-term contracts, poor pay, no equipment. We are networking nationwide via the “TVStud” campaign, which is calling for a collective agreement for student assistants. We are currently experiencing how the Presidential Board rules in an authoritarian manner, making decisions over our heads without any real participation or transparency. We want to fundamentally change these structures. Our goal is a university where everyone has a say and shapes things together, not just a few at the top.

Das AfD-Gutachten ist ein Blick in den Spiegel – man sieht die Demokratiefeindlichkeit der Verfasser;Tichys Einblick;<a href='https://www.tichyseinblick.de/tichys-einblick/afd-gutachten-demokratiefeindlicheit-verfasser/' target='_blank'>Das AfD-Gutachten ist ein Blick in den Spiegel – man sieht die Demokratiefeindlichkeit der Verfasser</a>;"We now know this - from a secret document whose mere publication is already illegal. This is not the media practice of a democratic state governed by the rule of law, where important political issues are dealt with in public. You can't find out anything about the AfD that you don't know or can google at lightning speed. Because only public quotes are strung together. Anyone who believed that something would be revealed under the threatening, ominous, dangerous heading “assuredly anti-constitutional”, such as a secret conspiracy to overthrow the party, weapons caches, training of assassins - none of that. It's about paper that is turned over, about words taken out of context, about artfully inflated claims and shaky constructions. One example: In Germany, an anti-Semitic battle is raging unhindered by Hamas supporters against Jews, who are being beaten down, threatened and insulted. Is the AfD involved? No. Although pages and pages of statements critical of Hamas by the federal executive, Alice Weidel, Tino Chrupalla and others are quoted, the office does not accept them: This is a far-reaching assessment. It is not substantiated. This is the method: making claims of the most threatening kind - counter-arguments are not perceived and certainly not included. Because, the observers: they actually think differently, and so “statements” are cited. How does that work? The BfV knows how: They would be, while they . Quite tricky, this AfD. And: You can't defend yourself against the BfV, because it determines what is REALLY meant. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution's rather adventurous twisting of words. Individual terms are coded by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution as “right-wing extremist”. Anyone who uses them consciously or unconsciously, deliberately or on a whim - say or write “Umvolkung” or “Überfremdung”, and that's it: You're right-wing extremist, and that's official. But do you seriously want to use individual terms to hang a party that is voted for by over 20 percent on such terms? You do. That is the method of conceptual denunciation. It works conveniently with modern computer writing systems such as Microsoft's popular “Word”. You enter words such as “block party”, “cartel party” and “system party” into the search mask, and if an AfD member or functionary uses them, they end up in the “right-wing extremism” basket. The procedure works at lightning speed, the more daring the allegations. And then it starts. On November 11, 2023, Rene Bachmann, a member of the Saxon Bundestag, shared a post on Facebook by David Bendels, the publisher and editor-in-chief of Deutschland-Kurier, and wrote about it: 'Well, an advertisement on our own behalf - already it's being reinterpreted as a massive attack. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution is seriously criticizing the demand to turn away from “the system media” in general. So anyone who is dissatisfied with the media landscape is “fundamentally questioning democratic institutions and structures themselves”? Alongside criticism of the state, criticism of the media is also discredited. It obviously does exist, the united front of media, parties and politics feared by Bendels and others. Even neutral, cautionary reminders of German history are worth a mention and plenty of space for the experts. This article takes up almost half a page: The Bavarian AfD state chairman Stephan Protschka (Mdß, BY) published a graphic on Telegram on February 22, 2024 with the following inscription: “ Allegedly the present is equated with the Nazi era. One rubs one's eyes: Where exactly? The description is correct.It is constantly repeated by left-wingers. It remains unchallenged there. A tweet by Tino Chrupalla on Facebook on November 26, 2022 also appears in the report under the heading “Equations with National Socialism”. Chrupalla had written: One is reminded of the embarrassing picture of the Minister of the Interior; lightly dressed, her counterpart correctly dressed and without an armband. After all, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution itself admits that this comparison is only a misleading one (p.586). Did Chrupalla equate Faeser with Nazis? Because of the armband in rainbow colors? Absurd. Such examples of language, terms used and AfD personnel are cited - but how reliable is this evidence? Where does legitimate expression of opinion end and anti-constitutional agitation begin? It's like looking in the mirror: it's not so much the AfD that is arguing in an anti-constitutional manner - the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution itself is crossing every boundary and seeing itself in the mirror: historical comparisons are always slippery. But this is not about questions of taste, but about whether a party can be hindered in its work because of quite exaggerated remarks. A quick look at the rhetoric of politicians from non-persecuted parties reveals an abundance of Nazi comparisons, appropriate, inappropriate, insulting, arbitrary, accurate or inaccurate. The party book determines what is allowed and what is not. In the case of Bundestag member Stephan Protschka (BY), one question he asked on Twitter on August 13, 2021 was enough for the observation case and the designation right-wing extremist: “I am now a second-class person, I am #Unvaccinated. Do I have to wear some armband now?” (S. 536). And the offense of Bundestag member Barbara Lenk (now: Barbara Benkstein; SN): She shared a meme from the movie “lnglourious Basterds”, in which Christoph Waltz as an SS colonel asks the question: “Lenk, according to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, set It's adventurous. Once again: you can argue about such remarks - but they are not proof of the alleged anti-constitutional subversion plans. And it's tiresome. How much state-paid brainpower was wasted here? The völkisch-nationalist world view, which according to the BfV is widespread in the AfD, plays a key role. The report describes the preservation of an “organically unified people” as the primary goal of the sub-grouping, albeit the dissolved “wing”. Now it is clear that the party leadership, party conference and party program distance themselves from this, many migrants are members of the AfD. But you can see the constitutional protectors smiling superiorly. With the means of their linguistic analysis, they look behind the word into the heart and brain and discover the real world of thought. “Certain population groups” are supposedly excluded from social participation by the AfD and subjected to unconstitutional unequal treatment. This is inferred from a wild hodgepodge of statements that are usually taken out of context or, worse still, are based on empirical observations. Woe betide anyone who writes about crimes committed by foreigners: In future, the media will no longer be allowed to report on schools in which children who do not speak German have long been in the majority - because this could spread fear. The secret service is thus crossing an important boundary: facts may not be reported and discussed if they do not fit in with the generally prescribed sense of well-being, but could cause disruption to the desired harmony. Demands for increased and improved integration, language skills and adaptation to local living conditions are also considered “anti-constitutional”. According to this interpretation, the police crime statistics, which determine the proportion of certain population groups in criminal cases, are “threat communication” that stirs up fears. Terms such as are the clubs that like or sexually motivated crimes may no longer be used - the naming of undisputed facts is now anti-constitutional. Many constitutional lawyers have long since classified this point of the ethnic-cultural concept of people as constitutionally irrelevant. However, according to the BfV, reality may still only be described if it does not deviate from the federal government's model. Facts are anti-constitutional. The democratic principle, and this is what the actual assessment is about, i.e. efforts to eliminate the free democratic basic order, would not have been “confirmed quantitatively and qualitatively to such an extent that they could be classified as formative for the party as a whole”. In other words, the AfD stands by democracy and the rule of law. But only those who violate this can be seriously described as enemies of democracy. Why then this stigmatization of the AfD, if it stands on the ground of the Basic Law and at most represents opinions that other parties do not run? Elsewhere, the “analysis” reads: “On the other hand, efforts against the free democratic basic order would justify a suspicion of extremism and would almost legally enforce observation of the party as an ‘assured right-wing extremist movement’. How does this fit together? The answer is nothing short of fantastic. In the process, prognostic assessments would also have to be made as to whether these would be pushed back - the constitutional protectors as prophets of democratic suitability. This is what it says in the summary from page 1010 onwards, so the Federal Office knows where the journey is heading. And that's where it slams on the brakes. And this is where it becomes really dangerous for democracy and the rule of law. But the danger comes less from the AfD than from the authority, which is doing what it very artificially believes it can accuse the AfD of doing: The office is destroying the democratic order and the rule of law with false claims and arbitrary “predictions” about future behavior. Why it should be “anti-constitutional” to want to limit immigration is not explained at any point.You can be in favor of immigration or against it - this is not prescribed by the Basic Law, and even then you are allowed to pursue other goals. It will be interesting to see whether the emerging parties of migrants will also be subject to this dictum - after all, they are based on the ethnic concept of the people by definition. But these groups are removed from the discourse. In general, anyone who makes statements that are critical of Muslims is generally guilty. According to the BfV, it is therefore important to protect Islam in all its manifestations and to prohibit debate about the cultural consequences and peculiarities. Because if a grievance can be traced back to a Muslim background - bang, anti-constitutional. This kind of hostility to debate characterizes and permeates the report: Not only individual points of view are criminalized - all criticism is banned across the board. This is because the public's trust is shaken by critical comments. The question is no longer whether criticism of government action is justified - but only “whether trust in the functioning of democratic processes is shaken”. This opens a wide door. Any criticism can be seen as an attack on trustworthiness. Conversely, it is not the mistakes of politicians, the media and political parties that are denounced, but the bearer of the bad news that is discredited. Conclusion: Please no more criticism, it could alienate citizens when people talk about corruption, abuses, misuse and illegality. Criticism of the pandemic policy is explicitly mentioned. This is to be accepted. Criticism of it: clearly anti-constitutional. The picture painted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution is bleak. The aim is to create a kind of muzzled society that no longer negotiates actual or perceived grievances. The result is absurd ideas. In December 2021, Florian Jäger, former AfD member of the Bundestag and at the time chairman of the AfD district association Fürstenfeldbruck (BY), compared the situation of the unvaccinated in view of the coronavirus restrictions to the situation of Jews under National Socialism on Facebook. In particular, he compared Markus Söder's warning against the unvaccinated (“pandemic of the unvaccinated”) during the coronavirus period with the warning issued by Reich Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels against the Jews in the Third Reich. In both cases, a , according to Jäger. Absurd: Jäger himself was initially sentenced to a fine for incitement to hatred (2021 and 2022), but was later acquitted by the Bavarian Higher Regional Court (2023). The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution is aware of this acquittal by the court and writes itself that its own sharp view is on shaky ground: “And the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution adds: The BfV simply knows better than any ordinary court. With this method, the report stirs up an unpalatable mash of suspicions, false conclusions, allegations and insinuations. Defending oneself against this is futile - the fact that the aforementioned Jäger has long since left the party or that other exponents have been excluded - none of this helps the AfD. It is the “forecast” that counts, and that suggests danger. The AfD can do whatever it wants. It is never enough. Although the AfD has expressed solidarity with the state of Israel in many articles and strongly condemned the terrorist attacks by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in particular, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution continues to accuse the party of anti-Semitism: , writes the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (p. 537). Although it quotes pages and pages of statements critical of Hamas by Weidel, Chupalla and the AfD federal association, it somehow refuses to accept them: (p. 539). Aha, the highest court has ruled: The finding for anti-Semitism has not been dropped, appeal impossible. This is the way to end debate and discussion in a country: words are charged with new meanings with malicious connotations and thus criminalized, and anyone who uses them consciously or unconsciously is guilty of right-wing extremism. However, the report has an unintended effect: anyone who rummages through the word garbage will find themselves somewhere. Every single person has used bad words at some point, surely. “On June 29, 2021, Karsten Hilse, citing an inaccurate and misleading report entitled 'Ministry of Education considers Chinese-style social point system for Germany', claimed that 'the heirs of Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin' in the Federal Ministry of Education and Research were planning to introduce communist re-education systems in Germany.” Why the TE report is supposed to be “inaccurate” and even “misleading” is neither explained nor substantiated in any way. The Verfassungsschutz simply makes this claim (p. 599). It was about a pupil assessment system that is indeed reminiscent of Chinese models. But writing this is no longer allowed. Sharp criticism is forbidden, as it could shake confidence in the omniscient wisdom and justice of a politician. And that is already “extreme right-wing”. This gives the impression that politics is being played here with state resources. And it is violent. It is a piece of political trash that is being poured over the country and polluting it.";left;{'center': 0.33169999718666077, 'left': 0.5885999798774719, 'left-center': 0.04349999874830246, 'right': 0.021299999207258224, 'right-center': 0.01489999983459711}
»Palästinenser in Israel sind die einzigen, die eine Brücke schlagen können«;Jacobin;<a href='https://www.jacobin.de/artikel/ilan-pappe-gaza-israel-palaestina-die-vergessenen-palaestinenser' target='_blank'>»Palästinenser in Israel sind die einzigen, die eine Brücke schlagen können«</a>;"Palestinians in Israel have a complex relationship with the state in which they live. For more than sixty years, they have been citizens of the country - but not fully-fledged citizens, as Israeli historian Ilan Pappe traces in his book. They navigate a precarious position between Jewish Israelis and Palestinians in the occupied territories. However, their experiences are rarely the focus of attention. In an interview with , Pappe talks about this special role. He discusses Palestinian history and discrimination within Israeli territory, what has changed since the book was first published in 2011 - and why Palestinians in Israel in particular could play a central role in peace efforts. The Palestinians within Israel are those Palestinians who were not displaced during the Nakba, the catastrophe of 1948. They have a very different history from other Palestinian groups because they were part of the Jewish state from the beginning. The other Palestinians were either refugees inside or outside historical Palestine; they came under Egyptian rule in the Gaza Strip in 1967 or under Jordanian rule in the West Bank.It was precisely during this period - between 1948 and 1967 - that the Palestinians in Israel were placed under military rule. Yes, military rule is what most people know today when we talk about the West Bank and Gaza. It is the same rule based on the same British colonial regulations. It gives the army a completely free hand in regulating the lives of the occupied population. The army can imprison people without trial, it can destroy homes and - in some cases - simply shoot people. That was the reality of Palestinians in Israel until 1966. While Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank only came under Israeli rule in 1967, the situation for Palestinians in Israel got better from that point on - they became citizens. I wouldn't say they became full citizens of the country, but at least they were no longer living under military occupation. But they were still subjected to somewhat more subtle forms of segregation and discrimination. Most of this discrimination was not yet enshrined in law. Before the 2000s, most Israeli politicians tried - at least in theory - not to push legislation that discriminated against people because they were Arabs and not Jews. Exactly.In 2000, Israeli politicians began passing laws against Palestinians in Israel. Practices that were previously unofficial were suddenly enshrined in law. Palestinians, for example, always had very limited access to land, they could not expand their territories - and suddenly it became illegal for them to do so. They were also no longer allowed to talk about the Nakba. This is all cumulated in the Nation-State Law of 2018, where it was officially stated that Palestinians can be individual citizens of Israel, but they are not allowed to be part of a national community. This does not only refer to the 1948 territory - between the river and the sea, the law says, there is only one nation and that is the Jewish nation. The discrimination against Palestinians within Israel is not as dramatic as in the West Bank, let alone Gaza. But if you compare them to Jewish citizens, they are second, if not third class citizens. Even before the legal changes of the 2000s, they lived in an apartheid-like state. Some also say it was a complete apartheid state even then. Palestinians were discriminated against all the time - not because of what they did, but because they are Palestinians. Yes, we always joke about it. A sociologist from Haifa once said that there was no need for a sample because he knew all of them personally. Zionism is a colonialist movement that has colonized Palestine for the last 120 years. But it is one of the few colonial movements where the language of the colonized was never learned and no romantic relationships developed. There were even more relationships between whites and Africans in apartheid South Africa than in Palestine. But that is the nature of Zionism, it is a Jewish ideology of superiority and exclusivity. That's why the pressure on mixed couples is so great. Most of them go abroad at some point. There is a very strong segregation, especially in education. But the universities and the business world are mixed. Public transport is not segregated either. An academic once argued: “This is not this form of apartheid where toilets, benches or buses are segregated. The segregation is much more hidden. That's why there are meeting places, of course, but I'll give you an example to explain my point: Israel has created several towns in the north of the country. The idea was that they should be exclusively Jewish in order to increase their numbers in the Galilee - because Israel feared that there were too many Arabs in the region. This project was called the “Judaization of Galilee”. However, there were hardly any economic opportunities in the Palestinian villages around these towns. That is why those Palestinians from the area who had a little more financial means were prepared to pay double or triple the rent to move to the newly created towns. So these supposedly Jewish towns are much more mixed today than they used to be - sometimes life is simply stronger than state ideology. So there is constant interaction between the two groups. Especially in Haifa, where I grew up. But the problem is that the political system, culture and education - they all try to destroy this interaction and genuine coexistence. There is a great effort from above to ensure that coexistence cannot develop. If it were left to the people themselves, I think it would develop. But if it were to develop, it would destroy the idea of an exclusive Jewish state. And of course the members of the Israeli political elite don't want that. It's like saying that the situation of women in India is perfectly fine just because India once had a female prime minister. Such symbolic successes are of course important, but they do not reflect the actual reality on the ground. Most of the people living below the poverty line in Israel are Palestinians. They are constantly discriminated against - by the police, the judiciary, everywhere. If they express their Palestinian identity individually or collectively, they run the risk of being imprisoned in their own homeland. Take the health system, for example: many Israeli doctors have emigrated, and some of these jobs have been taken over by Palestinians from Israel. Normally it is very difficult to get into Israeli health facilities because there are quotas. At the time when the Communist Party was relatively strong in Israel, Palestinians could study medicine in the Eastern Bloc. Today they do it in Italy and Romania. It's the same as in the mixed cities: Sometimes reality is stronger than ideology. But as soon as a Palestinian doctor today shows compassion for the children in Gaza - be it through a humane post on Facebook or another platform - he is threatened with suspension. When Israel was founded - at least until 1967/1968 - the country endeavored to maintain good relations with both the Soviet Union and the United States. It was also hoped that Jews from the Soviet Union would eventually emigrate to Israel. For this reason, the Communist Party was allowed to exist and operate - while any attempt by Palestinians within Israel to form a purely national party, for example, was discouraged. Some Palestinians may indeed have been attracted to socialist or Marxist ideology, but for many the Communist Party was simply the only political option that allowed them to be Palestinians. It was also the only party in which Arabs and Jews were treated equally. There were Palestinians in other parties, but they were rarely more than token representatives - certainly not equal members. In the Communist Party, on the other hand, Palestinians and Jews worked side by side, at eye level, with mutual respect and equal treatment. The party probably offered the best model of what a common life could have looked like. When Israel abandoned its relationship with the Soviet Union - especially when it became clear that the Soviet Union was siding with the Palestinian liberation movement - Israel's attitude towards the Communist Party became increasingly hostile. And like everywhere else in the Arab world, the left simply failed to deliver. It has neither achieved the liberation of Palestine, nor brought social justice, democracy or rights. That is why many people turned to other ideological directions. In Israel, many Palestinians were increasingly attracted to a clearer national identity - one that did not need to be masked by communist ideology - and to currents of political Islam. No, there was no such thing - for two reasons: First, the PLO decided in the 1970s that each Palestinian group should fight for the liberation of Palestine according to the circumstances in which it found itself. There was no pressure on Palestinians in Israel to join the guerrilla struggle that other Palestinian groups were waging in the occupied territories or from the refugee camps. Secondly, the Palestinian political and intellectual leadership in Israel made the strategic decision not to use guerrilla warfare to secure their rights and contribute to the Palestinian cause. That was a very conscious decision. And, of course, there was always the fear of a possible Israeli reaction. As we can see today in Gaza, such a reaction would very likely have been genocidal. As I have already said: Already since 2000, and especially since the election of the right-wing government in November 2022, the policies of the Israeli government and parliament towards Palestinians became very harsh - both by law and by practice on the ground. And this was all before October 7. Another point that has nothing to do with October 7 is the way Israel allows criminal gangs to operate largely unhindered in Palestinian villages and areas. These are gangs of young men who are heavily armed - and no one is trying to disarm them. Neither the police nor the secret service or the military. They are allowed to move around freely. They primarily fight each other for territory and influence, but as always, many innocent people are also affected. Murders occur almost daily - including murders of children. It is obvious that some of these gang members used to work with the Israeli secret service, especially before the Oslo Accords, and were recruited from the occupied territories. The Israeli government believes it benefits from this, as they call it, “Arabs killing Arabs”. That's why they don't care when people in Palestinian villages are terrorized. October 7 was used as an excuse to eliminate even the few remaining freedoms of expression and protest that Palestinians still had in Israel. Israel pretends that what Hamas did was carried out by the Palestinians in Israel. That is why they are not even allowed to show sympathy for the Palestinian babies killed in Gaza - that is seen as supporting terrorism. People are arrested for this, without trial. Many are afraid to speak out - they fear losing their jobs or being arrested. One of the leaders of the Palestinian community in Israel recently said that the situation today is even worse than during the military rule between 1948 and 1966. It is really a difficult and dangerous moment for Palestinians in Israel right now. We had hoped that after the initial shock and trauma, those who still see themselves as liberals in Israel would realize that the only way to change Israel is through the formation of a strong alliance between Palestinian and progressive Jewish citizens. But that is not happening. What October 7 has done is that those who considered themselves liberal Zionists have become more radical right-wing Zionists. Liberal Zionist political forces are practically non-existent. This means that the Palestinian community in Israel is further isolated. That is the short-term perspective. In the long term, I think October 7 was a wake-up call: the way the Jewish state has been developed - as a racist state based on oppression, occupation and ethnic cleansing - is not working. Yes, Israel is still powerful, has strong allies, and the Palestinians are weak and cannot liberate themselves or end their oppression. But they will continue their fight. And the world is beginning to understand that they are the victims - and not Israel. These processes will continue. We are already seeing that those Israelis who want to lead a normal, democratic, liberal life are not finding it in Israel - they are going to Germany or elsewhere. And those who stay behind don't seem to be capable of running a state. I'm not sure the United States will always be there to finance Israel's expenses. We also see that the international community - at least civil society - has had enough. Yes, it hasn't affected policy yet, but that will happen too. I think that, ironically, the Palestinians in Israel are the only ones who can build a bridge - from the unbearable reality of apartheid, genocide and ethnic cleansing to a real coexistence as it existed before the arrival of Zionism in Palestine. Yes, exactly. And one day, if there is reconciliation and a different reality between the river and the sea, then it is precisely these Palestinians who can create a win-win situation for both sides. Because if not, revenge will follow instead of reparation - and that is a terrible thought. This is why the Palestinian community in Israel is so important. And instead of understanding that their future lies largely in the hands of this very group of Palestinians, the Israelis are trying to destroy them.";center;{'center': 0.5083000063896179, 'left': 0.37709999084472656, 'left-center': 0.08110000193119049, 'right': 0.017100000753998756, 'right-center': 0.01640000008046627}
Landwirtschaft in Westafrika: Nachwachsende Probleme;taz;<a href='https://taz.de/Landwirtschaft-in-Westafrika/!6087174/' target='_blank'>Landwirtschaft in Westafrika: Nachwachsende Probleme</a>;The earth over which Mahamat Ahemat walks is bone dry. Only a few bushes and trees are sparsely scattered across the landscape, with mountains rising into the sky in the distance. The landscape in northern Cameroon is barren, at least in the dry season. But with the first rains, the green returns.  “The plants are reseeded each season,” explains Ahemat. They typically start in May or June, depending on when the first drops fall. As deputy head of Sodecoton's “Professionalization Service”, Ahemat's department is responsible for providing technical support to Cameroon's cotton farmers: from seed selection and training on sustainable cultivation methods to advice on pest control and harvesting techniques. With around 2,500 permanent employees and more than 3,500 seasonal and casual workers, the parastatal cotton company is the largest employer in the country's three northern provinces. According to its own figures, Sodecoton produced around 115,000 tons of cotton fibre in 2024/25. An output with which the company contributes around 15 percent to the agricultural gross domestic product. However, the production strongholds of North, Outer North and Adamaoua in particular show how vulnerable the whole thing is. As part of the Sahel, the region is one of the areas most affected by climate change in the world. Increasingly unpredictable rainy seasons, lack of rainfall and soil erosion are also affecting cotton farmers. Although Cameroon is one of the countries with the highest cotton yields in the whole of Africa, the population in the growing regions in particular suffers from chronic poverty.

Today, we sometimes plant with the first rain and then there's another dry spell. Then all the seeds are lost,” says Ahemat. In his airy blue boubou, a traditional West African garment, he stands out sharply against the colors of the landscape. Temperatures are scratching the 40-degree mark on this day. While Mahamat Ahemat's forehead is dripping with sweat, these are precisely the conditions in which the cotton plant thrives. It takes around 200 days of sunshine for the valuable natural fiber to thrive - provided it rains. The sale of cotton is a steady source of income for many families, but the growing conditions are harsh. Despite its economic importance, the reality of life for many cotton farmers remains precarious. In order to improve their situation, Sodecoton has been working with the German initiative “Cotton made in Africa” (CmiA) for years. The logo is clearly visible on the factory premises of the ginning plant near Garoua.  Mahamat Ahemat's gaze wanders over the harvested field in front of him. He runs his hand over a few stalks of old cotton plants that are still sticking out of the ground. “After every harvest, the old cotton fields are burned down so that no pests can take root,” he explains, pointing to the neighboring field. There, thin rows of piled-up rubble and earth form small barriers. The fields are laid out in terraces to protect them from the next heavy rainfall and the stone walls prevent the soil from being washed away. There is no longer any sign of the cotton that grew there last season. There is a loud clatter as the next truck approaches and reverses into the unloading station. There is a constant hustle and bustle on the huge factory site. From inside the ginning plant, you can hear the steady pounding and shaking of the machines that clean and sort the freshly delivered cotton. It only takes a few hours for the cotton to go through the entire process and be packed into bales and lined up in the courtyard. Ready for the journey to Asia. Most of the cotton produced in Cameroon is shipped to countries such as Bangladesh, China or Indonesia, where the raw fiber is processed further. The CmiA standard is accompanied by a commitment to certain social, ecological and economic standards. Fair pay is also one of the principles. To achieve this, brands such as Aldi Süd, Ikea and Tchibo pay license fees for certified cotton. This currently amounts to less than one cent per item of clothing. “A drop in the ocean,” says Roger Peltzer, independent agricultural consultant and cotton expert. What is actually needed is at least five cents per item of clothing, which could make a big difference locally. “To enable an average family of nine people to live a decent life, around 424 US dollars a month would be needed,” explains Peltzer, who was involved in the study on the so-called ‘Living Income Gap’. In reality, however, the average household income of producers is only around 50 percent of this, in some cases even just 25 percent. Around half of their income comes from selling cotton. The other half is earned by growing peanuts, vegetables or other agricultural products. The study by Sodecoton, together with the Cameroonian research institute Iresco and Afriland Bank First, puts in black and white for the first time what the farmers in the region have long known: The income is not enough. One of the main reasons for this is the prices. These are not set in Cameroon, but on international stock exchanges. If they fall, this has a direct impact on producers' incomes. At the same time, manual labor in the African cotton fields competes with fully automated large-scale farms in Brazil, China, the USA and Australia. Added to this are high transportation costs. Even though Cameroon has two large ports, Douala and Kribi, it is a long way from the cultivation areas in the north to the coast. Poorly developed roads, a virtually non-existent rail network and an unreliable airline add to the problem. “The cotton market is also simply oversaturated. There are many countries that are active in cotton cultivation because it is a good source of employment for the rural population. But this is one of the reasons why the price being paid is incredibly low,” says Sabine Ferenschild, researcher on textile value chains at the Südwind research institute. For the farmers, the low prices are coupled with constantly rising costs for inputs such as seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Added to this is a massive pest infestation. Since the beginning of the 2020s, the Jassids, originally from South East Asia, have been spreading throughout West Africa. Cotton in particular is attacked by the swarms, but the tiny parasites in the form of locusts do not stop at okra, eggplants and other agricultural products either. Entire harvests can be destroyed in a very short time. A disaster for farmers in the region. Dealing with the pests is difficult because the situation is relatively new and there are no proven strategies. Two jassid species newly discovered in 2022 also proved resistant to common pesticides and are spreading all the more aggressively. There is hope for two special insecticides that can be applied to the seeds. However, these have not yet been approved in Cameroon. The cotton farmers' association is pushing for approval. But while bureaucratic mills are known to grind slowly, in Cameroon they often don't turn at all. For decades, Cameroon's political landscape has been characterized by stagnation. President Paul Biya, now a proud 92 years old, has ruled the Central African country since 1982, making him one of the longest-serving presidents in the world. A long time to establish an authoritarian system in which democratic institutions have been undermined, political opponents have been silenced and media freedom has been severely restricted. Elections are to be held in October. There are many indications that Biya will continue to hold the reins of power. It is a policy of retaining power that has left deep scars over the last 43 years. Decisions drag on for years and reforms get bogged down in the administrative apparatus. The paralyzing status quo also has an impact on the cotton sector.   New approaches often get stuck at regulatory hurdles. Instead, the population organizes itself. Cooperatives are formed to support each other and take on tasks that should actually be in the hands of the state. Cotton farmer Ruth Ndin Divai, for example, reports that her women's cooperative uses the money set aside to pay for additional teachers for the village school. For years, the state has been sending too few teachers, especially to rural areas. To ensure that their children can still go to school, it is not unusual for the employment of an additional teacher to be jointly financed. The government is also unable to find answers to urgent security issues. In the far north of Cameroon - where most of the cotton is grown - the population is repeatedly exposed to attacks. Some are carried out by the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram, others by bandits. There is little difference between the methods used: fields are plundered, livestock stolen and people kidnapped in order to be ransomed for large sums of money. While the attacks by Boko Haram in Cameroon had subsided for a while, the number of kidnappings for ransom more than doubled in 2024 compared to the previous year, says Ladd Serwat from Acled, an organization that collects data on political violence and conflicts worldwide. This may be linked to the Chadian military's Operation Haskanite, which pushed many Boko Haram fighters from Chad back to Cameroon and Nigeria at the end of 2024. For farmers like Moussa Hina, this has concrete consequences: “If you had a good harvest with a lot of income, you shouldn't show it openly, otherwise you will quickly be targeted by the kidnappers,” he says. Kidnappings increase, especially during the sales phase for Sodecoton, “then people have money at home”, reports Moussa Hina. In order to better protect the farmers, Sodecoton is now promoting the establishment of cooperative banks. The aim is to minimize cash flows, especially during the sensitive sales period. Instead of keeping large sums of money at home under the mattress, producers should receive their money directly into accounts and be able to withdraw it safely when needed, explains Francois Kemai. As managing director of the Mufid cooperative bank in the small northern Cameroonian town of Pitoa, he runs the modest branch in the heart of the town. Just a few steps away, a stream of people and animals are jostling across the dusty marketplace this morning. It is cattle market. The loud price negotiations and shouts of the traders mingle with the mooing of the cattle. “Many of our customers now come to us straight after the market to deposit their money,” says Kemai. A heavy vault door protects the members' hard-earned deposits. As part of a network of cooperative banks, Mufid specializes in microfinance and offers savings and credit products primarily for small farmers in the region. At the same time, the aim is to reduce the risk of becoming a target for kidnappings or attacks. There is also support for this from Germany. The aid organization Misereor is also promoting the development of new Mufids, and the German cooperative association DGRV is providing advice on agricultural financing. At its core, however, mufid is a Cameroonian model that is becoming increasingly rooted in the communities of the north. It is also a model that is emblematic of a broader trend. Instead of waiting for the state, pragmatic ways are being found to deal with the existing challenges. Cotton is one of the key factors being addressed. Low wages, the often high use of pesticides and problematic working conditions have really tarnished cotton's image. Yet the plant can be used in a variety of ways, stores CO2 and, as a robust raw material, provides millions of small farmers around the world with an income. Moussa Hina is one of them. As a representative of the cotton farmers in his home region, he reports that many of his colleagues would like to invest in a tractor to make their work easier and increase productivity. More cotton, more sales, more money, so the calculation goes. Sabine Ferenschild from the Südwind research institute doubts whether this is the long-term solution: “Due to the oversupply, prices could fall even further.” More efficient production is one thing, but what is needed above all is pricing that takes into account the real cost of living. “A price that is below the cost of living is actually an immoral price,” she says. This is also the view of the authors of the study on the living and working conditions of cotton farmers. According to them, a joint strategy is needed to sustainably strengthen the resilience of the cotton industry.  Increased performance and access to financial services on the one hand, but also the diversification of businesses. 15 million euros are to be invested over the next five years, a third of which the applicants intend to raise themselves. Just under 10 million is to be provided by external donors. In the long term, the aim is to persuade major brands to pay higher prices. The fact that this has been attempted for years does not make it any easier. However, the study provides reliable data for the first time.

Der Karl-Eduard von Schnitzler-Preis 2024 für Propaganda und Manipulation geht an: „Correctiv“;Tichys Einblick;<a href='https://www.tichyseinblick.de/tichys-einblick/karl-eduard-von-schnitzler-preis-an-correctiv/' target='_blank'>Der Karl-Eduard von Schnitzler-Preis 2024 für Propaganda und Manipulation geht an: „Correctiv“</a>;"As we all know, politics begins with looking at reality. But what to do when reality doesn't fit? One of the earliest reactions is reported by the Greek historian Herodotus. The Persian Great King Xerxes had just built a bridge over the Helespont, today usually called the Dardanelles, in order to invade Greece. A storm thwarted this advance and destroyed the bridge. Enraged, Xerxes ordered the sea to be struck 300 times with a whip. And cut off the engineers' heads in the process. In any case, it was well known that beheading those who conveyed bad messages was quite popular. The raging sea was quite indifferent to Xerxes' lashes, at least according to Herodotus. Delivering bad news is considered dangerous. It is better to deceive the powerful. This is what Prince Potemkin did to make his beloved Empress believe that Russia was a prosperous country, even though it consisted of nothing but smoking ruins. It is said that Adolf Hitler was not dared to wake up on the night of the Normandy invasion. If he had been woken up, he would probably have released the tank reserve by order of the Führer, which would possibly have caused the landing troops a lot of trouble. Erich Honecker drove through a country whose houses were painted bright white up to the height of the second floor; beyond the perspective afforded him by the little Pepita hat sitting in the soft Citroen, however, the cities were gray. Rulers are surrounded by powerful bureaucratic apparatuses, but these apparatuses lie, without any artificial intelligence. Now there are two ways to expose the proverbial Potemkian villages. One way is to replace the powerful, usually by murdering them. This is cruel for those affected and usually comes as a surprise. Those who rule for a long time tend to move in the shadows of an invented reality. Democracy is also cruel. In the morning, still in the official car, with flashing blue lights and accompanied by a command car on the way to the Federal President's Palace, as a minister you take the streetcar or an Uber home after being dismissed. Instead of the air force, airliners are the order of the day, frustration, for example, for Joschka Fischer's then newlywed wife, who learned to love a minister and married a loser who could only offer Air Berlin, unforgettable images. Clever politicians gain their own insights. At the beginning of his time in office, Helmut Kohl invited pensioners from the “Bundesbüdchen”, for example, and had them explain the situation of pensioners to him. Neither the security department nor the pension policy department in the chancellor's office found this intrusion of unannounced reality into the designed reality of the social policy dream papers amusing. There is no such thing in Berlin any more. Even more trenches, even more steel fences, even more splendor and cleared green spaces increase the distance between what should be and what is. The new Chancellery building is destroying one of Berlin's most beautiful walks along the Spree. Friedrich Merz does not run the risk of bumping into a scolding pensioner. The world of illusion is perfected. The second way of allowing reality to break in is the invention of media. Controlling the powerful is their actual function. To write down or broadcast what should not be said. Bodo Hombach, Minister of the Chancellery under Gerhard Schröder, once told me: “Much of what could be done is not done because people don't want to read about it.” Our media landscape is not particularly well suited to continuing to exercise this control function. There is a risk of losing a place in Air Baerbock. The chance of swapping an insecure job in the media for a civil servant's job in the Federal Press Office decreases when members of the government are viewed critically. It's the sticky feeling of comforting closeness that makes you feel obligated. After all, we live in a country in which government offices are passed around between the CDU and SPD. Correction through elections is less likely than losing a ministerial office by party decision, as some ladies and gentlemen of the SPD recently experienced. Media are largely absent. For disruptive media, there is the EU's Digital Services Act and, in addition to the court in Bamberg, there are others who will follow suit. To ensure that nothing really happens, court media are used to produce their own reality, which is then taken over by other friendly media. Consequently, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has placed not only criticism of the government but also of the media system under observation as “assuredly right-wing extremist”. Critical media is being replaced by a media system of its own that creates governmental dream worlds. Correctiv is one of these dream factories. Thousands of readers have chosen this self-proclaimed research thing as the winner of this year's Schnitzler Prize. Last year, Jan Böhmermann was the winner. As we all know, he is working hard to perhaps receive it again next year. But for now, it's Correctiv. Correctiv was founded in July 2014 and is, according to its dreamy self-description, “the first non-profit research center in the German-speaking world”. The organization was founded by David Schraven, who previously headed the research department of the Funke Mediengruppe, which later emerged from it. Correctiv describes itself as a “media house oriented towards the common good that strengthens democracy”. The aim is to uncover abuses of power through investigative research, shed light on the consequences of the climate crisis and take action against disinformation. It was founded at the instigation of Bodo Hombach and with start-up support from the Brost Foundation. It feels committed to the SPD. Correctiv wants to conduct “research for society”. For years, the company bobbed along rather unnoticed and reported rather tormentedly on the alleged misuse of savings bank profits and similar dramatic incidents. Together with his wife, founder Schraven tried his hand at setting up a mobile coffee stall in Bottrop, which was intended to be a social meeting point at the Saturday market. It's never about something as mundane as making money. Society always has to be saved, even if it involves a construction trailer with an espresso machine. But of course it is not in the least dishonorable to constantly invent new business models. However, Correctiv achieved its first success during the coronavirus crisis. In order to prevent critical reports about government coronavirus measures, Facebook introduced so-called fact checks - as we now know: at the instigation of the US intelligence services. “Factchecking” quickly became a profitable business model and Correctiv went with the flow. The main aim was to suppress critical reports by labeling them as untrue or partially misleading. On our own behalf: Following a derogatory assessment by Correctiv, TE brought several cases against Correctiv before the Karlsruhe Higher Regional Court and was successful. In , the ruling was presented as significant for freedom of expression and the role of fact-checking in social media. This reveals another pattern that Correctiv has been using ever since: In a complete twist, Correctiv has since claimed that the ruling only affected fringe areas of factchecking. The non-perception of reality seems to be a behavioral characteristic. After all, the hands-off fact-checking was over. The profitable fact-checking came to an end because Elon Musk revealed that this was a favor check in the interests of and under pressure from the US government at the time. Facebook recently announced that it would stop doing this anyway because it became apparent that the fact-checkers were not so much checking facts as manipulating and sorting them according to ideology. Until then, a typical fact check by Correctiv, for example, described late effects of coronavirus vaccinations as “unlikely” in complete agreement with the official policy at the time. Baerbock's fraudulent CV also received a kind of acquittal from Correctiv. Even “cheating” is too strong a term for the process. And, of course, the reactor disaster following the Fukushima seaquake is proof of how difficult it is to “control” nuclear power plants, a seamless continuation of the campaigns against this form of energy generation. However, seaquakes and tsunamis are rather difficult to control. Farmers' protests are infiltrated by right-wing extremists. So much for Correctiv and the facts. Whether it's the CVs of green candidates, natural disasters or protests, Correctiv is always at the forefront when it comes to “de-realization”. My colleague Alexander Wendt has made a name for himself using this term to recapture reality and has thoroughly analyzed Correctiv in many articles. In any case, Correctiv had to look for new sources of income and discovered that the federal government's funding of activist NGOs was a new source of revenue. As early as 2022, Correctiv received 198,500 euros from the budget of the Minister of State for Culture and the Media, Claudia Roth In 2023, Correctiv received a total of 431,059.85 euros from the federal treasury, as well as 145,338 euros from the NRW state treasury. Since its foundation, the platform has collected a good 2.5 million euros from public sources as of mid-2024. Other rich sources of money are mostly US foundations, such as that of the US billionaire who contributed half a million dollars. That's more than you can usually earn with a coffee shop and a lot of work. But all this was just the prelude to the whole big show. And unfortunately, it is also the admission of my biggest journalistic misjudgement to date. On January 10, 2024, a text from the Correctiv platform “shook” the whole of Germany, as it has often been called since then. “Secret plan against Germany” was the title, and the introduction simply said it all, because it was all wrong. “High-ranking AfD politicians, neo-Nazis and financially strong entrepreneurs came together in a hotel near Potsdam in November. They planned nothing less than the expulsion of millions of people from Germany.” Migrants with German passports were also to be deported. Correctiv cleverly drew a historical parallel by mentioning that the meeting took place near the Wannsee Conference Center, where the systematic extermination of Jews was coordinated in 1942. To me, it all seemed pompous like a bullfrog; the Wannsee Conference involved the top echelons of the Nazi state, the party, the Wehrmacht, the SS and the Gestapo. At Lake Liegnitz, where the criticized meeting took place, there was a member of the Bundestag and a member of the state parliament from the AfD, a party without any executive function, apart from a district administrator and two village mayors. And I hope I am not opening any wounds when I say, dear Ms. Schröder, that you have no powerful office, no official car, no soldiers, that Ulrich Vosgerau, who is unfortunately not present today, is a member of the CDU and a brilliant constitutional lawyer, but is not a minister and does not command any divisions. The truth is that the Cologne administrator from the WerteUnion, who is also present, does not manage budgets worth billions, but essentially herself and a small office. The financially strong entrepreneurs are a dentist and a partner in a hamburger chain. Honorable people all, but “powerful people” who can move Germany and millions of its inhabitants? You have to be very detached from reality to derive a “plan to deport millions” from this. As far as I know, none of the participants had enough delusions of grandeur to be intoxicated by such fantasies of power and pretend to be king of Germany. It was a round table that discussed migration policy and the limitation of such things in a framework that shortly before Chancellor Olaf Scholz had similarly called for in an interview with the mass deportations. It is therefore a revolutionary project in Germany to roughly repeat the Chancellor's demand. We know from Lenin that Germans buy a platform ticket before they storm a train station. He couldn't have known about Correctiv. German revolutionaries are repeating their chancellor's ideas. But unfortunately at the wrong time. I won't bore you with the details, all of which have since been thrown out by the courts, and which are considered “dirty lies”. Just four days later, a major rally was held in Potsdam with Chancellor Scholz, the very same Chancellor, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and other top representatives of the state, the church and the famous civil society. In the weeks that followed, millions of demonstrators took to the streets to protest against the “deportation summit” - as the well-informed used to call it. Millions of demonstrators cannot be wrong. They storm stations that don't exist. But with a platform ticket. And my editors gave me a dirty look. In the morning conference, I had made it clear that we wouldn't comment on such nonsense. Quark only becomes broad if you kick it. So we had almost overslept a topic at the beginning, the biggest journalistic mistake. Shame on me. I'm just too old-fashioned. I don't perceive fictional stories as reporting material, if at all as entertainment material. I am notoriously committed to the truth and not to fairy tales. But that is the crucial point. We live in a world of the political-media fictionalization complex. What counts is no longer what is, but what is fantasized. Reality is now just a construction, and in this case Correctiv was one of the master builders. Today we know: The Federal Chancellor and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution were also involved. The President of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Haldenwang, chatted about it casually in front of several rounds of journalists. A real head of the secret service is involved in one of the biggest cases of disinformation. Incidentally, Haldenwang was not criticized for this, but because we reported on the fact that journalist groups received this information and kept it to themselves. Respected Berlin journalists are thus participants in a conspiracy against reality. Anyone who nevertheless names what happened is threatened with expulsion. Journalism and government have grown together. You can't make it up. You have to have experienced it. But there is room for improvement. Correctiv has been awarded a series of journalism prizes for its leadership in this state spectacle of shenanigans, this fake news drama. Well, the Sparkasse Leipzig. They are probably embarrassed by the Monday demonstrations of 1988. Medium magazine has honored the authors as “Journalists of the Year”, which reminds me: I should actually give the prize for Business Journalist of the Year back to Medium magazine. It's a way of soiling oneself intellectually. And at a point in time, this award, at a point in time when several newspapers, including the old auntie ZEIT, were very late, too late, in examining the fairytale of lies and the driving forces behind it more thoroughly. This is a special feature of today's Germany. The fictional reality can no longer be shaken by anything. Facts are for nothing, arguments are beside the point, shadow images are projected onto us, which we have to take for reality. In front of the building of the actual Wannsee Conference stands a metal memorial plaque that treats the deportation plan from Lake Liegnitz as historical truth.Distrust the history books in Germany.However, the sentence is missing.Because this “research collective” is the undisputedly most successful dream factory.From the point of view of the German government, every euro spent on Correctiv is money well spent:There is no more efficient way to fool people.No invention could be more primitive, turning a stupid idea into a state spectacle.And almost everyone went along with it.The Germans always like to join in when leaders storm platforms.My congratulations and deepest respect for this chutzpah.And an apology.We named this prize after Karl-Eduard von Schnitzler, the chief propagandist and baron of lies of the GDR.We do him an injustice.Compared to Correctiv, he was an honorable man.He was comparatively fact-based, a model of journalism compared to Correctiv. 
But perhaps this apology is superfluous. And Karl-Eduard von Schnitzler bows respectfully in his grave to his students in the service of the Federal Republic of Germany. The final question is: between Herodotus and Honecker, in the open-ended Correctiv scale of the most serious lies, where do we place Germany?

</a>";"A new knife attack every day, most recently in Hamburg with 18 injured. Before that Bielefeld, Halle, again and again Berlin, Solingen. A stabbed toddler and a murdered helper in Aschaffenburg; an attack on a speaker and a stabbed police officer in Mannheim. These are not isolated cases. The figures are now on the table. 80 attacks every day, recently admitted. This is no surprise. At least 60 knife attacks per day, this figure was painstakingly calculated by TE author Matthias Nikolaidis for the year 2022 - this analysis was published almost exactly two years ago. Naturally, TE was publicly berated for this. A growth rate of 30% in serious violent crime in two years - politicians clearly don't care. Facts are not publicly acknowledged or are suppressed if at all possible. They could worry the population, as former Merkel Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière (CDU) explained the strategy of concealment. The victims are quickly forgotten, who remembers Kandel? In the Mia V. murder case, an Afghan who had arrived in Kandel (Rhineland-Palatinate) the year before as an unaccompanied minor refugee stabbed a 15-year-old girl to death on December 27, 2017. The perpetrator was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for murder and assault under juvenile criminal law; he should have been free again long ago and enjoying his life. There were protests at the time following the murder of the girl. That should not happen. Since then, a whitewashing machine has been running. Relentlessly. Professionally. The deeds have been suppressed. Just as other forms of extreme violence with the same effect have been suppressed: In Munich, deaths because a car crashes into a demonstration. In Cologne, explosives attacks and hand grenades are part of the police situation; Moroccan gangs are fighting with clans of various origins for the lucrative cannabis market, which was supposed to be decriminalized through the liberalization, as the former health minister Karl Lauterbach assured us. In Frankfurt, little Leo is pushed in front of an incoming ICE train and dies. While people in Hamburg were still fearing for the victims of the latest knife attack, an uninvolved passer-by in Essen, who had been caught up in a clan war in the street, was shot and seriously injured. This time too, in Bielefeld, as in practically all cities affected by murder and manslaughter, demonstrations against the right are quickly organized as soon as the blood is halfway coagulated, for the benefit of the perpetrators; this about this confused act. Again and again the embarrassing slogan that the incidents should not be “instrumentalized”. It's another word for whitewashing. But those who whitewash do not want to clear things up. Each act stands on its own and must be assessed on its own merits. But of course there are patterns, clusters, confessions. In criminology, this is called “profiling”, a method in which a perpetrator profile is created on the basis of evidence and behavior. Even if we don't want to admit it: The majority of perpetrators are Muslim - not all of them. They are recent immigrants - not all of them, but most of them. In many cases, they are diagnosed as mentally disturbed, like the perpetrator in Frankfurt, who wanted to push mother and child to their deaths, or the double murderer in Aschaffenburg; the perpetrator in Hamburg also falls into this category. She was also known to the police. According to a conservative estimate, at least half of the crimes are prevented from being punished in this way. But diagnosis and whitewashing overlap: does a healthy person attack a completely unknown toddler with a knife? This individualizes acts. That is practical. The police, judiciary and authorities can shrug their shoulders: there have always been sick people, prevention of mental illness is difficult. Or is it a pattern after all? Is there a profile of the perpetrators and are there triggering, accelerating factors? Brutal violence has become the “new normal”. Everyday life “no longer has to be renegotiated on a daily basis”, as red-green politicians demanded. Violence is the new everyday life; we know where this culture comes from, finds imitators and conquers the public space. Even children reach for knives, just as they are shown and often enough preached to. “A gloomy rear building, a remote side street, a dark backyard - would you suspect that mosques and Islamic associations are hiding in precisely such places? Islamic schools where children are taught separately from their parents in order to lay the foundations for fundamentalist ideas from an early age? Mosques in which hatred against “kuffar”, or unbelievers, is openly preached?” As early as 2018, Ismail Tipi called for measures to be taken “before it is too late”. It is too late. It feeds on itself. Those who ridicule the host society for its generosity and at the same time devalue it, call women whores if they do not wear a veil, insult infidels, have an effect. Boundaries are pushed when murderers from and in Syria or the Gaza Strip are celebrated as martyrs in mosques, on the streets and in universities and the slaughter of bystanders is glorified as the liberation of infidels. First the sermon, then the deed. Parallel societies develop their own psychodynamics, want to bring their own laws with them and live them out. Seyran Ates and Ali Ertan Toprak describe them as counter-societies. They nurture hatred for all those outside the community. Secret societies have been formed; TE knows the names of those affected who fear for their lives and therefore no longer want to appear by name or in person. Islam critic Hamed Abdel-Samad is protected around the clock by four officers, at every turn. The awareness of right and wrong is slowly shifting. The war of cultures is being fought out with knives on Germany's streets, and the police are “reacting linguistically inappropriately”, as a police investigation revealed: “Hello, my girlfriend is being raped right now,” the caller to the Bonn police whispered into the phone, “by a black man”. The policewoman inquired suspiciously: “And someone is attacking your girlfriend or what?” A woman's whimpering came through the receiver from the background, accompanied by a male voice. “He's got a machete,” replied the interviewer. “You're not taking the piss, are you?” the policewoman followed up. “No, no,” replied the caller, saying that the perpetrator had a huge machete with him. The policewoman says goodbye with a dull “Bye” and the rape by a Ghanaian, a rejected asylum seeker, continues. It was just another woman. Not only the murderers are among us. Also the trivializers. Analysis and persecution are made taboo. In these days when, in addition to murders, a bullying affair involving a gay teacher in Berlin became known, homophobia among young Muslims should not be talked about. The perpetrators are reinterpreted as victims. Accusations of racism are leveled at anyone who dares to defend themselves. An ideology of victimization dominates the media, the judiciary, politics and the police. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution takes any criticism of Islam as an opportunity to infer that it is anti-constitutional. This also applies to this text - according to the Federal Office's criteria, it is “definitely right-wing extremist” because it criticizes what should not be criticized. According to the BfV, Islam in all its forms must be protected and the debate about its cultural consequences and peculiarities must be prohibited. Because if a grievance can be traced back to a Muslim background - bang, anti-constitutional. Politics has long been characterized by whitewashing, cover-ups and trivialization. The police crime statistics are based on a “filling-in guide” in which violent acts of left-wing and/or Muslim origin are blamed on alleged right-wing extremists. An outrageous process, which can be read in detail here: it is a deliberate deception - and the necessary observation and prosecution are thus blocked. The left eye is blind, Muslim-motivated crimes and connections are not allowed to be addressed anyway. This continues into the Bundestag; the treatment of the opposition party shows what every critic is threatened with: exclusion, disparagement, abuse. It affects parties, politicians, but also individuals, writers and filmmakers. A perfect system of blindness has been developed - with downright macabre consequences: The police also become victims. The perpetrator who stabbed a policeman in the neck a week ago is also released after brief questioning at the police station. There was no evidence of intent to kill. That's great. The only way to explain the incident is that the policeman must have exposed his neck and thrown himself into the knife when he approached the rioting perpetrator. This only causes a stir when it involves animals. For example, an arson attack on the Munich police riding squadron. While extremists struck under cover of darkness, six emergency vehicles were in flames and a stable was ablaze. What is taking place here is a silent, undeclared war against the country's own population. Population, dear reader from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, is not understood here in ethnic-cultural terms. Fellow citizens with roots in Greece, Poland or Turkey are also horrified. Anyone who has sought a good life in Germany and worked hard to build it up can become a victim of the new immigration - which Angela Merkel still defends today: unteachable, cocooned in the cocoon of - and which her successors in politics continue to pursue. The only measures are repeated knife ban zones and bans on sharp objects and spray cans, with the effect of increasing defencelessness. According to the logic, those who defend themselves are living the wrong way. An attitude of victimhood is being enforced. No, Friedrich Merz cannot evade responsibility here. So far, he has played the innocent bystander. Listen to his words: “The news from Hamburg is shocking. My thoughts are with the victims and their families. My thanks go to all the emergency services on the ground for their rapid assistance. I have just spoken to @TschenPe on the phone and offered him the support of the Federal Government.” They are the familiar set pieces from the phrase machine. In case you didn't understand: The confidential so-called TschenPe is Peter Tschentscher, the governing mayor of the former Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. That's how people throw teasing nicknames at each other in the worst and most serious hour. According to this logic, we will soon be able to call Friedrich Merz @MerF. But a head of government should not be bothered with such silliness. Internal security in Germany is not under threat - it has turned into a merciless war of the new culture against the old. The fact that the youngest members of all sections of the population are adopting the imported violence is particularly bad. But the worst thing is that the political-media class is shrugging its shoulders and looking the other way. Take over, Merz, or leave.";center;{'center': 0.7325000166893005, 'left': 0.15629999339580536, 'left-center': 0.08150000125169754, 'right': 0.016200000420212746, 'right-center': 0.013500000350177288}
